Deviate works can be free-minted as NFTs at \t\t\t4C, and the subsequent transaction proceeds of these deviate NFTs will be shared with authorized NFT holders and creators. In addition, 4C mainly includes two parts: \t4C CLUB and 4C DAO. The mission of 4C CLUB is to make every NFT have a good comic story and generate new transactions and value around these comic NFTs. \tThe 4C DAO's mission is much more difficult, to help comic creators create great comic stories.\r\n\r\n\tWe believe that Web3 will give birth to a new batch of world-class comic creators and comic stories, and Web3 should have a new \"Marvel\".\r\n\r\nProject Highlights:\r\n\tAdequate amount of derived NFT IP\r\n\tMore accessible to creating comics for Web 3\r\n\tEverlasting work of art\r\n\tNO PUBLICATION FEE\r\n\tFREE MINT\r\n\t$C token rewards\r\n",

These are proper objects and it can currently  tell the difference between picture, audio and video NFTs.  Others (BAYC, etc) could be added.\r\n\r\nAs Metamask is a bit unpredictable, I now use their upcoming SDK for allowing my app to talk to their app.  This involves refactoring some of their code which I hope to give back to them.\r\nhttps:\/\/redfivesoftware.visualstudio.com\/MetamaskMobileDotNetSdk\r\n\r\nThen there is my library which aims to put a simple interface ontoa technical process. \r\nhttps:\/\/redfivesoftware.visualstudio.com\/Web3Mobile\r\n\r\nGiven some funding I would like to maintain this library and expand it as the users need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Also he tax will be fairly distributed back to the addresses to incentivize them for future transaction.\r\n\r\nUniverz is a decentralized database and multi vendor Marketplace platform with cryptocurrency reward. Based on the Ethereum blockchain network, that is supported by the Buyer\/Seller community, that builds and interacts with cryptocurrency rewards.

They can earn it by doing active work (leaving positive feedback, governance, voting, buying and selling),  The creation of such an internal economy is arguably one of the most important outcomes, and one that must be sustained over time.\r\n\r\n",

Do you have an awesome idea or strategy to combine different Dapps in order to maximize yields or capital efficiency?\r\n\r\nIntroducing Daemons, a platform that allows anyone to become an advanced blockchain user. Daemons can help you\u00a0create blockchain-related actions tied to certain conditions\u00a0(called\u00a0Scripts). You can choose a set of actions, related to everyone\u2019s favorite Dapps, and tie them to a condition. Your request is stored and when the condition is satisfied, the script will be retrieved and executed in an \u201cIf this, then that\u201d fashion. All this, in a non-custodial, decentralized manner.\r\n\r\nDoes this look interesting to you?\r\ndaemons.fi is a community based protocol and needs your help to make it!\r\n\r\nWhy Daemons?\r\nBefore Daemons, users with no coding experience could not automate custom actions and had to make do with pre-built actions provided by the various platforms they used. This presents a certain amount of friction between non-technical users of DeFi and smart contract functionality. Platforms and contracts are not flexible, like all pieces of sophisticated software. It requires time and know-how, to prepare, debug, audit, and test a variety of smart contracts in order to automate the simplest of actions.\r\n\r\nAs such, Daemons was inspired. To remove the boundaries towards a decentralized and personalized finance management tool. Particularly, Daemons\u00a0allows you to create personalized scripts to interact with your favorite DeFi platforms, in no time, with no programming knowledge, for free. DeFi should be enjoyed by everyone, not just software developers. Everyone should have the ability to create their own strategies and have them up and running instantly, without hassle or costs.\r\n\r\nSome basic examples possible:\r\n\r\nPerform a DCA, buying tokens every week.\r\nTake profit\/stop loss whenever the price of an asset is greater than X.\r\nExit from a high-risk LP pool, removing 10% of the liquidity every 5 hours.\r\nSwap some tokens each time your balance is greater than 0.\r\n\r\nDaemons gives multiple primitives that can be mixed and matched to create personalized scripts that can fit any need.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nThe execution flow always follows these steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent State Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading!\r\n\r\nFeel free to join our community at https:\/\/discord.gg\/43yuVeMBVp.\u00a0\r\nFor more information, please use the link below: https:\/\/linktr.ee\/daemons.fi\r\n",

With existing projects like Circom and Zk Block, and existing programs like 0xPARC and ZK HACK, the space needs an actual usable dApp to tie these all together. zkMachineLearning is the project that will attract experienced developers in Web2 to join Web3. Traditionally, machine learning bounty platforms, such as Kaggle, require developers to submit their full model to the host for performance verification. The evaluation process is often black-box and rankings cannot be verified. With zkML, we can verify private data with public models, or verify private models with public data (https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/4847\/zkml). That means we can now host bounties that developers do not need to fully disclose their model, and model architecture and weights are only disclosed when the bounty is paid. The application I am building aims to be an all-in-one end-to-end platform that ML developer can quickly convert their models trained in say Tensorflow or PyTorch into a zk-compatible one. The platform will include a library (circomlib-ml, already published and constantly updated) of Circom circuits that compute common layers in Tensorflow\/PyTorch, a Python-Circom translator (in development) that will transcribe ML models in Python into a Circom circuit, and a dApp that will host, verify, payout bounties.",

This saves time and cost by reducing the complexity and security risks involved in using any of the bridging solutions to move assets across chains. \r\n\r\nCompared to other options in DeFi, when a user swaps using Magpie Protocol, they don\u2019t need to go to the corresponding bridge, learn how to use it, spend a bunch of gas on transfers and time waiting, only to then have to go back to the DEX to make a swap. \r\n\r\nWhile in some ways similar to 0x, Paraswap, and 1inch, the advantage of Magpie Protocol comes in its user experience, security, ease-of-use, and speed, all while providing users with the best prices on tokens both within-chain and cross-chain.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Vision: \r\nWe\u2019re shaping the future of how people interact with financial systems built on decentralized, fair, and universally accessible technology. \r\n\r\nOur Mission:\r\nTo empower users of all levels by building a cross-chain infrastructure service that offers a simple, efficient, and secure way to trade, invest, and transact within DeFi.\r\n\r\nOur Values:\r\nSimplicity, Efficiency and Integrity.\r\n",

		"description": "With Banxaas, we are trying to create what will help senegaleses, even broadly west africans, to overcome the current state of hyperinflation, and centralization around our banking system. Firstly, the absolute banking rate of our population is around 20%, while the relative rate, which include the mobile money sector is around 40%. \r\nFor those who are fortunate enough to be able to save money in a bank, they won\u2019t get more than 3% in annual return, on average. \r\nAnd if they dare to borrow money, they would pay a minimum of 5% of interest rates. When the credit is given by a microfinance structure or through a nanocredit company, the borrower would pay more than 10% of interest. \r\nOur local merchants and businesses struggle to pay their suppliers due to the weakness of our currency, and to the high fees requested by local banks for international transfers. The migrants also pay really high fees to remittance companies.\r\n\r\nOur pilot has the goal to make possible the following : \r\n- A local exchange would allow the population to easily possess Bitcoin and be their own bank. They would buy and sell Bitcoin with local payment methods. \r\n - Merchants and businesses can use Bitcoin bought on Banxaas to send securely to their suppliers, with fees near zero. \r\n- Migrants can send funds to their family via Bitcoin, which they can sell it on Banxaas to receive fiat currency. Fees are also near zero. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, Banxaas will be a native website, connected to several Bitcoin nodes. The addresses will be generated by some multisig wallets and the accounts will be secured by the state of the art of security and cryptography.\r\n",

An open-source project to educate, support, and bridge web3 for the renewable energy environment. \r\n\r\nEnergy & Node is seeking a grant to fund our development of an open-source application for demand-side management, as well as the purchase of mining nodes to support energy and power-focused blockchains. \r\n\r\nDemand-side management, or demand-side response, is the modification of consumer demand for energy through various methods such as financial innovation incentives and behavioral change through education. Energy & Node will be influencing both. Our application, named Aware, will allow consumers and utility providers to share data in real-time. Allowing utility providers to make better predictions on the demand and supply of energy to the grid, and allow consumers to support the stability of the grid, while sharing and accessing that data with their neighbors. Users will get a simple mobile application, that encrypts their identity and data through decentralized IDs, and provides a modern and easy-to-navigate interface to receive notifications and submit data. \r\n\r\nYou can watch the demo of our app from EthDenver here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0jDaBwo8b-Q&t=2s&ab_channel=DoraHacks \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Energy & Node will run mining nodes to support these blockchains as we seek to integrate as both a dApp and a partner in collaboration towards blockchain to support renewable energy:\r\nEnergy Web Chain\r\nPowerledger Chain\r\nCelo Chain\r\nChia Chain\r\nTopl Chain\r\nWatr Chain\r\nCosmos Chain\r\nAlgorand Chain\r\nGreenTrust Chain\r\n\r\nWe are seeking funding for equipment purchase of machine hardware.  Miners will initially be set up at a home office, and as equipment is added, we will migrate to a weather-proof, outdoor center fully powered by renewable energy in the mountains of Colorado.\r\n\r\nFinally, but not in the scope of this grant, Energy & Node will provide free resources about blockchain in the energy and power environment. We believe every individual (consumers and professionals alike) needs to be powered with the awareness and knowledge of this transformational technology as we move to a net-zero world.",

We offer Vaulting as a Service to DeFi and Blockchain projects as well as users in order to help them maximize their liquidity and earnings. Crystl Finance is listed on the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet app and we have partnered with multiple large partners including ApeSwap and Relay Chain to provide Vaults and build liquidity.\r\n\r\nWe have released our own unique Vaulting and Yield Maximizing Strategies through our V3 Vaults and Ultra Farms which have been fully audited (link to audit: https:\/\/polycrystal.gitbook.io\/polycrystal-finance\/security\/v3-vault-audit-by-hashex). With V3, we are able to stack multiple contracts on top of one another allowing for innovative and powerful yield maximization strategies. For example, we can create a strategy where you can stake USDC\/USDT LPs and earn ETH\/BTC that auto-compounds allowing users to DCA into blue-chip tokens without having to worry about impermanent loss.\r\n\r\nWe are also able to streamline the user experience with our Zap Functionality which allows users to go from a single token to an LP deposited in the Vault in one transaction. We can also \u201cBoost\u201d our Vaults with additional rewards in order to build greater liquidity and attract new users.\r\n\r\nOur long-term vision of Crystl Cross-chain expansion and development comes in 3 phases (full presentation here https:\/\/www.beautiful.ai\/player\/-N2lG199RfAngm_3flmn\/Crystl-Vision):\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Novel Yield Integration\r\n\r\nThis comes in the form of our V3 Vaults and Ultra Farms which support and build DEXes and DeFi projects. Our novel code will give users numerous ways to invest as well as allow for smart contracts to be built on top of one another creating innovative chains for yield maximization and wealth management.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Cross-Chain Strategy\r\n\r\nCrystl will expand to multiple new blockchains with marketing support, protocol introductions, strong grants & incentives, and aligned visions to ensure an effective launch.\r\nWith our expansion, we incorporate our in-depth website analytics to create agile marketing dashboards to consistently improve and optimize the user journey and experience.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Cross-Chain Smart Yield Aggregation\r\n\r\nOur final phase will introduce revolutionary new ways for users to seamlessly maximize their yields across multiple chains.\r\nSimplified User Flow - Users are able to deposit the tokens that they own, choose the earning token that they want, and select their risk tolerance to achieve the ultimate personalized strategy\r\nOff-chain Machine Learning and Graph Algorithms - Based on the selected criteria, an off-chain database uses ML and graph database algorithms to route the optimal path of yield aggregation across different chains and earning opportunities.\r\nCross-chain Compatibility - Using the algorithms, users' funds are sent or leveraged across multiple chains without them having to worry about or using new chains.",

		"description": "Buckets wants to make saving a fun and customized experience with blockchain-based saving games and goal-focused piggy banks.\r\n\r\nTLDR\r\nBuckets is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) app that helps you pick crypto investments that fit your goals. It's all about setting goals, creating a plan, and investing accordingly in cryptocurrencies and DeFi. \r\n\r\nHaving received initial funding from Aave (a reference in the space), our four-person team now requires additional financing to keep going. As part of our efforts, we will continue to integrate third-party protocols such as Aave, develop the saving games, and perform a complete security audit of our code base. \r\n\r\nAll of this is thanks to your support.\r\n\r\nIt's up to you what the next few months hold for Buckets! \r\n\r\nWe need your contribution to shape our vision of creating better saving habits for everyone. Even the smallest contribution count thanks to Quadratic Funding!\r\n\r\nYou're awesome! Thank you so much in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mission\r\nBuckets makes it easy to invest with personal goals in mind.\u00a0The mission is to democratize the web3 ecosystem and to promote a sound financial discipline powered by DeFi, in a fun way.\r\n\r\nThere were three main motivations behind the creation of Buckets:\r\n1) Benefiting from smart contracts and the blockchain technology permitting transparent and cheap financial transactions\r\n2) Limiting investment risks, which are too often neglected when dealing with cryptocurrencies\r\n3) Improving the experience for the end-user thanks to on-chain saving games\r\n\r\nThe protocol\r\nThe app has three modules:\r\n1) Goal: helps you define your savings goals using an excellent framework\r\n2) Investment: invest in the best projects and saving games that are suited to your goals\r\n3) Tracking: a best-in-class portfolio monitoring tools\r\n\r\nOn top of providing decentralization (no custody, protocol integration), Buckets introduces a measure of investment suitability to tackle the lack of risk measures in the cryptocurrency space.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information with the following resources:\r\nWebiste: https:\/\/www.buckets.digital\r\nMedium: https:\/\/medium.com\/@buckets\r\nTwitter: https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/savewithbuckets\r\n\r\n\r\nA message from the founder\r\nDeFi can unlock limitless opportunities. Thanks to composability, protocols can combine as Legos to create new features. I am convinced that the biggest innovations remain to be seen, but what we're building with Buckets surely takes advantage of such disruptions made possible by blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nThis led me to learn web development from scratch 2 years ago and to dedicate all my free time to this project ever since. As a result, I received funding from the Aave Grants DAO allowing me to finalize an initial version Buckets (Q3 2022). We are now 4 people working on the project and are continuously discussing the future of Buckets with our community on Discord.\r\n\r\nFurther funding is necessary to finally shape our vision of a fun and interactive savings app. When it comes to Buckets, we're aiming for long-term goals, not short-term gains. Creating value for users will always stay on top of our minds!\r\n\r\nI hope the project and my story will inspire you and convince you to go on this adventure together!\r\n\r\ncleyfe.eth\r\n#SaveWithBuckets",

To determine that which documents are worthEditing and altering in that specific study? When evaluating candidates, you will strongest indicate references to existing works. Failure to that, the assistant might decide to alter the samples and flow of\u00a0paper writing help in the paper. We all understand that alterations in the structure and format of academic essays reflect how well the student wants to submit their work.

Every individual should be confident with the helper they hire to manage whatever challenges occur. Below, we have some qualities that represent the features of an excellent online dissident editorial writer. When seeking to join an elective college, one has to pay attention to learning objectives. Maybe you want to boost your scores or achieve better grades by presenting world-class report papers to the supervisors. Now, who is a proficient teacher and lecturer? A degree show levels of educational qualifications. Great tutors will always evaluate students\u2019 abilities. Be quick to select an individual whose focus is education and research. In that case, you are straight to the point.\r\n\r\nAnother trait for an editor is the ability to communicate efficiently. Does that enable him to seamlessly navigate the entire paperwork? Can he convey instructions with confidence? If you are from a family, the language barrier will be lessening. As long as you have a good understanding of the locale, you\u2019ll be comfortable working with colleagues from that culture. Every book that I edited in school has to pass strict tests. An editor knows the correct way of translating official materials. Besides, most of these resources have been published.

Some of the staff have been fired under the pretext of \u201cnot passing the newly approved tests.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAnalyze the further reasonable course of actions taking into account the psychological peculiarities of each employee.\r\nThe challenges\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAssessing the discharges from a legal and social point of view;\r\nEvaluating the potential and professionalism of each employee;\r\nCreating feasible strategies for each of the people involved.\r\nThe measures\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDesigning specific questionnaires;\r\nObtaining the information on the employees from the human resources department;\r\nConducting tests to assess the features of each employee\u2019s temper.\r\nThe results\r\nCalculating the number of the people who managed to find another job;\r\nMarking the ways in which the latter managed to succeed;\r\nOffering conclusions and comments on the case.\r\nSimple and well-organized, this is a striking example of a fruitful case study. Seize the day and get your own case study done!\r\nCase Study Research Writing: Warning! Avoiding Misleading Ideas\r\nWhenever you deal with a case study, remember that there are a number of pitfalls to avoid! Beware of the following mistakes:\r\nExcessive use of fairly\u00a0restrictive phrases (even though it is a study of a real case, it should sound formal);\r\nLack of statistical data\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(give all important data, both in percentages and in numbers);\r\nDetails abuse\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(state only the most significant facts);\r\nInconsistency of methods used (in a case study, theory plays a relatively small part. Develop a specific case study research methodology);\r\nTrivial research means\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(create as much as you can on your own, from questionnaires to tables. Design your own case study research method!).Now you are ready to start your own research on a case study. Congratulations!\r\nNursing Scholarship Essays: What to Focus on\r\nEven if you are good at writing essays, it does not mean you will create the same perfect nursing scholarship essay. However, some skills of yours will definitely play an important role.For instance, your dedication to learning and ability to focus on the most significant things to be included into an essay is one of the keys to writing a strong nursing scholarship essay. To help you narrow down the focus, we have listed things that students are supposed to tell about if they want to get a scholarship:\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Past experiences;\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accomplishments;\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Future plans and career goals;\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reasons why you deserve this scholarship.\r\nThis is what makes nursing scholarship essays strong. Besides, you should focus on these particular areas.Keep in mind that a mere retelling of the major events from your life is not a good way to make an impressive nursing scholarship essay. Here are several hints on how to make your essay stand out.\r\nTell about your greatest accomplishments\r\nA story about your major achievements is what can make the reader of your nursing scholarship essay think \u201cWow, this student really deserves this scholarship!\u201d Mind that not all your achievements may seem the same great to the reader. Probably, a story about 100 pancakes that you managed to bake in 2 hours will not fit.\r\nTell about obstacles on your way\r\nYour ability to manage problems is another way to impress the reader. Yet, do not create some sort of a sad story for your nursing scholarship essay. Do not just tell how difficult a problem was, but how you overcame it.\r\n",

So, which branch do you want to investigate while working on your Management paper: risk management, human resource management, or project management?\r\nWriting papers on Management: theory and practice\r\nNo matter what branch you choose to investigate in your Management essay, the paper editing should be started with studying theory.

However, if you cannot find a relevant case study, do not worry. A lot of ordinary, everyday situations can be good illustrations to theoretical issues you discuss.Say, you are talking about one of the four functions of management \u2013 planning, controlling, organizing, or leading. Why not provide real-life examples of how you plan your studies? How do you control your pocket money? How do you organize your working day?\r\n",

Students apply to UDAO, if they\u2019re admitted, they\r\npay their tuition and in exchange they gain; 1. admission to their degree program and 2.\r\ntheir tuitions worth of University coins. When they graduate, if we can create a\r\nmarketplace for liquidity, centralized or decentralized, students can sell their token on\r\nthe market and go to school debt free. The goal is to end student debt by essentially making Universities investable assets for the first time ever through tokenomics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd17 Important links:\r\nUniversitydao.xyz\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/UniversityDAO_\r\nWhitepaper: http:\/\/bit.ly\/3tgha0R\r\n\r\nWe're looking for grant funding right now in order to acquire legal counsel for incorporation. Upon incorporation, we're aiming to raise $50m in donations. 80% of 50 million would go towards the endowment we establish and be invested while the rest would go to degree program creation.\r\n\r\nDegree programs take a long time to create, in the beginning, the endowment returns will be the only source of income we have, so we've chosen to start with the UDAO endowment in order to build the University in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nAny grant funding not used towards legal counsel will go to the UDAO treasury where we will either allocate towards program development or the endowment.\r\n\r\nIf you're deeply interested, read the whitepaper, it has everything from the political context we operate in, to the direct roadmap we have for the university as a whole.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWHITEPAPER:\r\n---------------------------Intro, Pre-Face, & Political context--------------------------\r\n\tSince the late 11th century, Universities have been local, centralized, entities,\r\noperating as the arbiters of truth, knowledge, and education. In the traditional University\r\nsystem we have today, Boards, Trustees, Presidents, and Regents among others\r\ncontrol most of the governance structures employed within the primary educating\r\nsystems of our world, ultimately marginalizing the very people the Universities serve in\r\nthe first place, the Students. Sure, most Universities hold student body senates that\r\ninfluence the governance of universities, but in most cases, student bodies usually lack\r\nany form of formal authority to really make a difference on the Universities policies and\r\ninitiatives.\r\n\tOn the other hand, student debt has reached $1.75 trillion in the US alone.\r\nThe world needs an answer, our nation needs an answer, and our children, the ones\r\nwho will bear the brunt of our failures, deserve to live in a world where education is\r\naccessible to all. Our education system has failed us, Universities and the general\r\npublic expect the government to subsidize our higher education, yet, the very\r\neducational institutions themselves have done little to quell the true reason our debt rate\r\nhas hiked, that is, that the tuition rates our Universities set for entrance to their\r\ninstitutions have increased over 100% in the past 20 years. No amount of\r\ngovernment spending can bandage a hole in the wall that keeps growing. But even\r\nthen, sympathy must be administered to our failed institutions, for the hard problem they\r\nface, is that quality of education is directly proportional to the amount of money an\r\neducational system has to teach. In some ways we can\u2019t blame Universities for\r\ncharging more if it helps them provide a better education in the end.\r\n\tSo, as a result of the inherent hard problem of education, the government cannot\r\nphysically solve the issue of student debt alone. In this frame, it is our belief that\r\nUniversities themselves not only must do more to bring down the student debt ratio, but\r\nthe US government must empower universities to solve the student debt issue\r\nthemselves, through the creation, amendment, and reformation of legislation that is in\r\nfavor of innovative approaches for educational institutions to do so.\r\nThroughout the rest of this paper, we will present a novel approach for a higher\r\neducational system that unites the government and its educational institutions, together,\r\nwith its financial markets, through the creation of UniversityDAO, a tokenized University\r\nthat aims to end student debt and empower our nation's scholars to truly own their\r\nUniversity.\r\n\tWith that being said, UniversityDAO is still largely in concept. Much of what is\r\npresented in this paper is subject to change and comes with its risks, assumptions, and flat out flaws. We hope that the readers of this document will come together to not only\r\ncritique and absolutely bash the approach we\u2019ve crafted, but to come together in order\r\nto form a more perfect University system that solves the hardest problems of education\r\nwe face today.\r\n\r\n----------------------------Continued in whitepaper---------------------------\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "What is DeKnow ID\r\nIn short term, DeKnow ID = decentralized Google Scholar + DBLP, data fully in user\u2019s control.\r\nWe will transform any scholar\u2019s academic life as data on chain, secured, privacy protected, under people\u2019s full control.\r\n\r\nProblems Statement\r\nAs a student, professor, scholar, scientist\u2026\r\nI don\u2019t have a way to show my academic reputation to the academic community and future employers.\r\nI don\u2019t have a way to be recommended with great prospective students\r\n\r\nDeKnow Solution Proposal\r\nDeKnow will first create a permissionless, non-custodial web3 identity for scholars and science. With the success of which, we will help community build an collboration web3 ecosystem powered by DAO, connecting scholars, students, enterprise in research activities and day to day life.\r\n\r\nDeKnow ID\r\nWe will have two parts to the project: On-Chain Smart Contracts as interface and protocol to hold Scholar and Paper, and webapp to serve as scholar personal portal.\r\n\r\nBootstrapping Seeding Profiles and Papers\r\nPublic records will be retained via Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Graph to construct initial scholar profile and paper citation references. Going forward, users will be incentivized to add more and more accurate references in DeKnow ID platform directly.\r\n\r\nCollect Real Person Resume\r\nResumes are the most accurate and update to date for academic students and scholars, much more than industrial. The project will focus on having scholar to submit resume to mint scholar profile NFT.\r\n\r\nA.I. for matching Student - Professor\r\nWith accurate information, DeKnow ID platform can match and recommend students and professors accurately.\r\n\r\nOn-Chain Smart Contracts\r\nBoth Scholar and Paper will start as current NFT ERC721. Both are transferable with specific considerations for Papers.\r\nScholar NFT will hold relationships with papers, relationships with other scholars, scholar reputations.\r\n\r\nPaper NFT will create a new protocol for co-owned NFT, hopefully later contribute back to Ethereum foundation community. With research paper nature, a paper will be co-owned by co-authors, contributions distributed, decisions to be made by having full or partial consensus betwen co-authors. It functions as a \u201cmini-DAO\u201d on the paper level.\r\n\r\nOff-Chain Webapp as scholar3.me\r\nThe webapp serve as a personal portal for scholar to show, view, manager owned Scholar NFT and Paper NFT.\r\n\r\nDeKnow Ecosystem\r\nComing after DeKnow ID is in place\r\n\r\nMilestone #1: Pilot: DeKnow ID Webapp and NFT\r\nDelieverables\r\n- Chrome Extension to capture google scholar url\r\n- Backend services to parse and capture google scholar information\r\n- DeKnow ID webapp on testnet, enabling user to upload CV, mint NFT\r\n- DeKnow Scholar NFT and Paper NFT are live on testnet\r\n- * TestNet is TBD. DeKnow can be deployed to any EVM compatible main chain. Initial choice is Ethereum Rinkeby and Polygon or Oasis.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria\r\nHigh Level: NFT, Webapp, Plugins are tested by 20 users, successfully minted scholar and paper NFTs with end-2-end flow.\r\n\r\nBreakdowns:\r\n- User can install the chrome extension by downloading local package\r\n- User can use the extension to save their own google scholar url, to create a minting proposal on DeKnow App\r\n- User can mint a DeKnow ID by either\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- minted by DeKnow ID team as bootstraping courtesy, OR\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- minted by uploading a local resume\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- minted by uploadind a resume via public access url (google drive, s3, arwearve, etc)\r\n- User can login into the DeKnow webapp and see their own identities\r\n- User can view other's DeKnow ID profile by having a direct link\r\n- Logged In user can edit and upload Bio\r\n- DeKnow webapp shall show the following information for the associated DeKnow ID:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- The scholar BIO\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- The papers that are co-authored\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- The DAOs the user is in on snapshot.org\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- The events the users attended, that were recorded in POAP\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nBo Li: Bio: https:\/\/aisecure.github.io\/\r\nDr. Bo Li is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In the reference valuation, strangers will have a tacit understanding of the model knowledge and historical performance of the valuation model, forming an implicit Schelling point, which is actually also an implicit valuation range. In other words, it is the same as constructing a real-time dynamic evaluation range for each NFT, and users can generate the final effective price through group bidding, forming a highly accurate NFT valuation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNawarat will give different reference valuations to meet the reference needs of different users, and display them on the valuation decision page in the form of a series of reference prices in the end. The list of reference prices will help us establish a range to find the Schelling point. The reference price deviation curve will help users to formulate a more accurate pricing range and thereby, finding the Schelling point from within. The final valuation of each round is then confirmed through group game based on the more precise pricing range of different users. \r\n\r\nTacit understanding between strangers. Referring to the historical\u201c performance curve, there may be an implicit Schelling Point, supposed 69.49ETH, which is a rough appraisal generated by models. Taking the implicit Schelling point as the reference valuation, a tacit bidding interval [63.20, 72.22] is naturally established, and ultimately the user will generate a more accurate valuation within this interval through group game.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs shown in the demonstration below: Each line with different colors\uff08\u25b3P1\uff0c\u25b3P2\u2026\u2026\u25b3P8\uff09, represent the difference in reference price and each round\u2019s final price under different models, the lines forming the reference price deviation curve, the closer the line is to x-axis then the smaller the gap is between reference price and final price, the closer it is to the final price. For instance, when a user bids on the next round of NFT valuation, \u25b3P8,69.49ETH can be confirmed to be the next implicit Schelling point having referenced the below reference price deviation curve, the tacit bidding interval between users is [63.20, 72.22]. The reference price deviation curve can greatly benefit users in finding the Schelling point, and can immensely improve the efficiency and the accuracy of valuation.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe theoretical basis of Schelling point defines the valuation range, and the normal distribution will find the precise valuation amidst the range, confirming the most accurate NFT valuation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0In the valuation of NFT, we can delineate the valuation and reference range of NFT through the theoretical basis of the Schelling point. When a group bids on a NFT with a reference valuation range, and if the resulting valuation data present to be a normal distribution spread, then Nawarat believes that this outcome is an effective valuation with a precise valuation result screened by normal distribution.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nCurrently, there are various AI valuation models widespread in the market, they are mostly NFT valuations based on various historical prices, which is very general and vague, involving no subjective judgment of NFT users, making the resulting valuation meaningless. Nawarat respects all of the factors, ranging from historical prices to group consensus, finding the ultimate precise valuation through the three-layer screening of AI model, implicit Schelling point and normal distribution.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBy introducing a list of reference prices, Nawarat establishes a range for finding Schelling points, helping users to find Schelling points with the help of the constructed valuation deviation curve, which formulates a more precise valuation range for users. The final and precise valuation of each round will be then confirmed through group game, further verified through normal distribution. Meanwhile, decentralization makes the valuation more reliable, resolving the trust issue associated with the AI pricing black box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Iris was conceived as an effort to produce a technological solution at the intersection of blockchain and space technologies. Iris is a Decentralized Terrestrial Satellite Oracle Network (DtsON) - the first of its kind.\r\n\r\nAn oracle network\u2019s function is to guarantee the delivery of honest and up-to-date real-world data from a pool of participating data reporters or nodes. Each node submits what it attests is their honest observation of the data point or state the network is trying to provide. Only through the consensus mechanism and committee mechanics of oracle networks are we able to find accurate values for the prices of cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges for example. For Iris however, instead of comparing single valued numerical data, Iris\u2019 nodes will compare satellite imagery and determine the image closest in similarity to the super majority (or 66%) of all the other images. We refer to the image chosen by the committee as the Average Scenario. The Average Scenario represents the most likely state one would find the AoI around the time requested.\r\n\r\nWith this system in place, dApp developers can for the first time trust that the information they eventually find in the image is representative of reality. extract data from the satellite imagery and Once dApp developers understand they can use Iris to extract information, they will have to create their own DONs to extract and verify the information. Doing so would allow dApps to perform permissionless computations that run only upon the behest of the user.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe idea of chaining a base DON with a Data Distilling DON or ddDON and then connecting the ddDON to a dApp executed on an EVM-like chain will allow users and dApp developers to trust the honest and faithful execution of each step in the product stack. The guarantee of honest fulfillment of financial contracts between people has never been greater than with blockchain technology and bringing oracle technology to geospatial data will extend this to new dApps.\r\n\r\nAside from reinventing the carbon credit\/asset market, Iris can be used to extract information for other kinds of dApps. For example, one could build a natural disaster insurance and\/or crop insurance application on top of Iris by extracting information that would change the state of the dApps smart contracts and trigger a pay out. Another way to use satellite imagery is to attach imagery of homes and property to on-chain property claims.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Ongoing optimizations will likely push it towards a minimum of 400k - 500k tps with 650k tps being the current target for this testing phase.\r\n\r\nThe platform comes with an inbuilt stock\/asset exchange that processes stock trades at a lightening speed and at the same time provides maximum security with its full proof consensus mechanism. \r\n\r\nThis on-chain exchange cuts out market makers who mostly act as middlemen on many CEXs and DEXs. Cutting out the middlemen gives the platform the ability to process trades with absolutely zero transaction fees.\r\n\r\n Cryptocurrency blockchains have been widely adopted and accepted by a huge number of retail investors and some institutional investors and as a result have seen a surge in its usage and value over the past few years. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there is a large portion of influential institutional investors who still remain skeptic of the value, use and importance of cryptocurrencies to the finance industry and economies as a whole. Despite their popularity, cryptocurrencies and blockchains have failed to fully permeate the finance sector due to a lack of trust in these new technologies. Institutional investors like Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are the biggest skeptics of cryptocurrencies. They cite the lack of real world value backing of cryptos as their biggest reason for staying away from big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana etc. These investors are used to investing in assets that have real world backing like stocks, as these are valued by the company\u2019s efficiency in providing their services and many other factors. Meanwhile, the value of cryptocurrencies is simply based on supply and demand which makes it purely speculative and unpredictable. This tends to keep many influential investors and some retail investors away from potentially investing in the cryptocurrency market. \r\n\r\nStartups and small companies in developing countries and in some cases developed countries in most instances find it difficult to raise funds. A very high percentage of startup funding is totally concentrated in many centralized and bureaucratic institutions making access to these funds hectic and difficult for many of these startups. Some of these startups are located in countries affected by sanctions which makes accessing the more developed world for funds to develop and grow their ideas problematic.\r\n\r\n Currently, there isn\u2019t many reliable well developed decentralized platform or blockchain to help these small companies raise funds. Bech blockchain\u2019s design specifically tackles these problems. Bech is a platform built specifically for stocks trading in its unit stablecoin Bece. These stocks issued by startup companies are backed by the services and value of these companies. Investors can then buy packs of startups or companies they trust and these startups get to raise money to fund their projects. This will help bring more influential institutional investors into blockchain technology by providing a fast and secure decentralized blockchain platform for investing in startups and companies across the globe. As more of these investors come to trust the Bech blockchain, the adoption of many forms of blockchain technology will increase in the finance industries and all other sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "ABYA is on a mission to train and equip 1M+ university students on blockchain and cryptocurrency by 2027 across accredited universities in Africa, starting with an MVP in Kenya, then scale to the rest of Africa. This is informed by the underdeveloped infrastructure which has made Africa a perfect vector for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, only requiring a smartphone to access blockchain networks. Africa is the second-most-populous continent in the world, with around 1.3 billion people. Due to historic issues with colonialism, civil wars, and harsh terrains, African countries have suffered from infrastructure problems for a long time. This has made financial services less accessible, leading to around 57% of the population remaining unbanked, meaning that there will be a large portion of the population moving onto the internet. According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s Q1 2020 report on cryptocurrency adoption, Africa had the second-highest adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. The continent had a percentage youth growth of 91.47%, owing much to Nigeria\u2019s 210.6% growth in young crypto users.\r\nThe project begins with a proof of concept in Kenya where the initiative will target membership in 60+ accredited universities. Based on the success of the pilot in Kenya, the template will be replicated to scale up the operations in the rest of the region drawing from lessons learned.\r\n",

Most likely you would pay month by month to see how it goes and decrease your risks.\u00a0So why is it not the same with VC funding where a startup gets awarded large funding round with a high probability they won\u2019t make it and the investor loses it all?\r\n\r\nThe crypto company investing model is broken- riddled with the process and capital inefficiency and risk. Investor-founder collaboration is not systematic and characterized by inefficient capital and milestone management, and inexperienced founders learning to scale. milestoneBased is the first company to leverage a blockchain DAO and escrow smart contracts in an automated governance and funding collaboration platform.\u00a0Early-stage investors use our platform for capital efficiency, to eliminate risk, improve transparency, and get more data-driven insights for a\u00a0faster path to monetization of deployed funds. Startup teams are motivated and synchronized with investor expectations and more focused on the right KPIs for strengthened performance.\r\n\r\nStarted in 2018 by a team of blockchain and startup industry veterans, milestoneBased enables any early-stage startup to list company roadmap milestone goals, and connect and collaborate with crypto VC and Angel investors on the platform to provide funding. Funding decisions and governance are voted on as part of the DAO and funds are securely held in an escrow smart contract till milestones are verified and voted complete. The platform also offers a host of startup education tools and will introduce the tools for AI and performance analysis for investors.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe are developing a full-circle web3 platform where startups can be connected to investors and raise their funding and manage the roadmap efficiently. At the same time, investors can find their perfect portfolio fit, help the project as a value add-investor, and accelerate the path to their desired ROI.\u00a0\r\nMilestoneBased as a solution is going to impact the whole crypto ecosystem influencing mass adoption by raising a level of trust to motivate teams as well as bring more investment players to the crypto company ecosystem, leaving such concepts as scam projects and fraud in the past.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur advantages:\r\n\r\nPipeline and portfolio management system for investors\r\nDeal flow sharing module\r\nStartup KYCs and ranking systems in future\r\nThe Roadmap library and memos feature as a knowledge-sharing hub for the community.\r\nWe operate on BSC which gives us higher TPS and at the same time our architecture allows us to adopt other chains in the future.\r\nWe have developed a set of Token utilities that benefit the constant growth of the token.\r\nOur product is already working and having its first users on the platform\r\nOver time we became a feature-rich platform almost an operating system for crypto VC\r\nEnterprise-ready access level management\r\nViral features for self onboarding\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\n\r\nWebsite:\u00a0https:\/\/milestonebased.com\/\r\n\r\nWhite Paper:\u00a0https:\/\/milestonebased-landing-files.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\/documents\/milestoneBased-Whitepaper.pdf\r\n\r\nOne-Pager:\u00a0https:\/\/assets.website-files.com\/60c7363bafd95b2b47d76282\/623ab93ef1bf008cd2114b68_milestoneBased-One-Pager.pdf\r\n\r\nFigma with deal sharing feature:\u00a0https:\/\/www.figma.com\/proto\/TX5NSECIeePYuTkLpub4mY\/MB?page-id=356%3A4&node-id=368%3A468&starting-point-node-id=368%3A468&hide-ui=1\r\n\r\nPress release:\u00a0Check here\r\n\r\n",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/6931\/eth-xmr-atomic-swap-continued-development",
		"description": "Atomic swaps are a method for trustlessly exchanging funds across blockchains. An ETH-XMR atomic swap will allow for users to, in a trustless and completely decentralized manner, exchange Ether for Monero. This connects the leading smart contract blockchain (and the home of defi) with the leading privacy-preserving blockchain. Along with the BTC-XMR atomic swaps, this will allow for completely decentralized cross-chain exchanges to be built that allow for XMR swaps.\r\n\r\nThe project currently has a functional prototype that has been deployed onto testnets. This grant is for continued development work, including usability and privacy enhancements.\r\n\r\nPrevious work\r\n\r\nPreviously, I completed an MVP implemenetation of the ETH-XMR atomic swap, deployed it to stagenet on 9 different servers, and extensively tested it. There is now an alpha release of ETH-XMR atomic swaps with the following functionality:\r\n- `swapd` program which executes atomic swaps; includes:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- network layer which allows for peers to make offers and discover and take offers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- RPC server which allows users to interact with the daemon (eg. make\/take offers, get current swaps, cancel swaps)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- protocol implementation of the atomic swap including all refund paths\r\n- `swapcli` program which implements a CLI for users to interact with the daemon and easily make\/take offers\r\n- `swaprecover` program which allows for funds to be recovered in case of a crash\r\n- `ui`: a self-hosted UI for the swap that displays current offers on the network and allows users to take offers using their MetaMask wallet.\r\n\r\nProposed work\r\n\r\nI would like to continue work on the ETH-XMR atomic swap implementation by adding improvements for usability and privacy, as well as general codebase maintainence. \r\n\r\nThis proposal includes the following development work:\r\n\r\n1. Relayer support\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the protocol requires the ETH-recipient to have some ETH in their claiming account to pay for the transaction fees to claim the swap ETH. However, this is bad for UX and privacy, as users cannot withdraw to fresh ETH accounts. \r\n\r\nTo allow for users to claim ETH into a fresh account, integration with a relayer service can be implemented. This will allow users to withdraw to a fresh account by paying a small fee to a relayer to submit the transaction on their behalf.\r\n\r\n2. ERC20 support\r\n\r\nTo support swaps for ERC20s without hurting liquidity, the swap contract can be integrated with a DEX such as Uniswap to automatically swap received ETH for the desired ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n3. Disk permanence\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the swap does not store anything to disk apart from information needed for recovery of swap funds in case of failure. However, there are other components that should be stored to disk and restored upon reload, such as current swap offers made, historic swap information, and peer information. This will require a simple key-value database implementation.\r\n\r\n4. General maintainence and bugfixes\r\n\r\nSee https:\/\/github.com\/AthanorLabs\/atomic-swap\/issues for open issues on the repo. Issues not covered by the above work are part of this section. This includes RPC calls and documentation, codebase maintainence, testing, and fixes of any bugs found during testing.",

		"description": "The Update & Upkeep Challenge is a competition open for solo stakers and enables ETH staking node operators to compare themselves with their acquaintances around the globe in a shared & fixed timeframe. Furthermore we use the framework of the challenge to collect and share data for the ecosystem & reward supreme network performance with a NFT, hand crafted according to different local artist's interpretation of what the word \"BLOCKCHAIN\" inspires in them. Nobody draws twice! \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\ud83c\udfc6 COMPETITION PAGE \ud83c\udfc6\r\n\r\nFor the challenge we developed a simple Discord bot for the validator key registration to the competition as well as a challenge leaderboard chart to compare your own performances with your peers in an anonymous fashion.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nTHE IDEA\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat got the idea behind the Update & Upkeep Challenge going was to design & develop different gamified, non consequential formats to keep the stakers more directly involved in their responsibility & ensure long term engagement of non institution backed individuals. After all, there is no other requirement than to burden the responsibility of running a staking setup to join the challenge.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe NFTs Prices awarded so far can be found here:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\ud83e\udd47 NFT PRICE COLLECTION \ud83e\udd47\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo create the prices we commission young artists to create something inspired by the space & are happy to introduce the concepts of NFTs to people in a traditional art environment. We also featured physical prices based on the NFTs, which we hope to bring back soon!\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDING\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe past iterations of the challenge came already with extremely positive user feedback. We heard some great tales of node breakdowns and mishaps from the users while distributing the badges and engaging with the community. With the funding we want to address further security concerns, harden cheating prevention, hire more artists and generally level up what one can do with the NFTs!\r\n",

It is a popular choice for packaging because it produces high-quality images.\u00a0\r\nDigital Printing\r\nDigital printing is a type of printing that uses digital technology to print the image directly onto the paperboard. It is a popular choice for packaging because it is less expensive than offset printing.\u00a0\r\nCustom printed rigid boxes are one of the best ways to package products.

This is a popular choice for packaging because it allows the customer to see the product inside.\u00a0\r\nFinishing Coats\r\nFinishing coats are applied to the surface of the box to protect it from damage.\u00a0\r\nUV Coating\r\nUV coating is a clear coating that is applied to the surface of the box.

The template includes a ready-made table of contents with notes on what to include in each chapter, easily adaptable to your department\u2019s requirements.\r\nAfter your written dissertation is approved, your committee will schedule a defense.

Well, this depends but one I know, surely not for NFT members, I didn\u2019t plant it in full yet, potentially the non NFT version of engine would contain some ads, which profit from would be used to continue to growth the project, fund necessary infrastructure around it and share part with NFT members who has access to engine? Definitely transparency is what I demand for my community, as much, as for this to be proper 21st dApp, so during the growth, there will be a lot of chances to vote and decide about the project!\r\n\r\nAbout me? I\u2019m just a full stack dev with thousands of ideas, for improvements for the of community, for past 12 years freelancing web development, working in IT infrastructure full time, now since web3 is new, the hype, I\u2019ve spent past 6 months of all my free time, on updating myself, studying blockchain development. I look to publish many ideas in the crypto world and see if they will be seen, if others see as me, that we can still focus on building this world better, rather than mars.\r\n\r\nHope this project finds you well, I\u2019m thinking of few names for it, so I won\u2019t be disclosing them yet, maybe we will do some voting for initial investors to choose\/propose the name? I want community to decide, not some big corpos.

		"description": "OZKi is a MICS Capstone Project focused on users' privacy protection. At the highest view, it aims to help web developers to protect the privacy of web users. The main problem OZKi is trying to mitigate is the ubiquitous PII leak problems.\r\n\r\nOZKi has two main components: the OZKi Toolkit and OZKi Oracle service, which together provide a secure end-to-end proving system. OZKi is based on the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), which is used primarily in the blockchains and Web3 ecosystems. However, OZKi is specifically designed to help Web2 developers to implement privacy-protecting software components with minimal effort and without requiring the need to use a blockchain.\r\n\r\nIn addition to lowering the bar to access the ZKP technologies, the OZKi framework also brings in real-world external data through the oracle, securely protects the input to proving function, and mitigates the proof replay attacks. OZKi toolkit defines the ProofGenerator and the ProofVerifier typescript classes that webapp developers can use to generate a zk-snark proof on the client running in a browser or nodejs, and to verify the proof on the service side.\r\n\r\nOZKi enables the concept of ID-less server design in which the traditional sign-in process is replaced with proof-based authorization flows such that the server does not use or store any PII on its end. The OZKi BOT demo app shows how one can implement proof-based authorization flows such as Proof-of-Payment with PayPal and Proof-of-Login with Google. With the proof of payment flow, the server can reliably verify if the user is a paid customer without knowing anything about the user. With the proof of login flow, the server can determine if the user's email login matches a particular domain without knowing the email address itself. In both scenarios, the user's PII is never sent to the server and is thus wholly protected.\r\n\r\nOZKi uses Polygon Iden3's circom language and compiler toolsets for writing the proof functions.\r\n",

DAO is a new type of management that was born for governance.\r\nAs the most in line with the spirit of blockchain governance, DAO must have its place in the blockchain ecological map, and is an indispensable and important piece of the puzzle.\r\nWhat is the Cityflysky\r\nCityflysky is a DAO that provides tools for DAO organizations, and its core is to provide rich, easy-to-use DAO tools for creating and using DAO.\r\n Cityflysky will provide an easy-to-use DAO creation tool that requires minimal gas and a few minutes to fill in the data to create a DAO.\r\nDifferent DAOs will provide a one-of-a-kind city NFT .\r\nOur Vision\r\nVoluntary commitment\r\nSince the name of DAO is \"Autonomous Decentralization\", there is no specific authority. In the \"company\", the \"CEO\" makes decisions and gives instructions to the \"employees\". In \"DAO\", there is no \"CEO\" in the first place. Of course, there is no concept of \"employee\" either. In DAOs, the pyramid structure is basically negated. The premise of working at DAO is that \"everyone actively demonstrates his\/her special abilities and contributes to the project\". You are always a \"proposer\" and a \"contributor\", and the DAO needs your advice and contributions. It can be said that in order to work in DAO, your project and your interests need to have a high degree of fit. Your contribution is maximized when \"what you can\/want to do\" and \"what the DAO should do\" overlap. If you work for a DAO, no one will give you directions. If you can contribute a lot, you will be recognized as a \"core contributor\" and will be rewarded and honored.\r\nRegardless of age, gender or nationality, pay for performance and participate anonymously \r\nIn the past, when working at a company, it was necessary to verify the identity of a person, but at DAOs, this common sense is outdated. When you work for the DAO, you are not required to provide more personal information than is necessary. Because DAOs are anonymous, they are also paid per contribution. Regardless of your age, gender or nationality, what matters is your contribution to the DAO. Prehistoric worker spirits, such as \"work earlier than others, show loyalty\" and \"be loyal to your boss\" are completely a thing of the past. Welcome to a flat, pay-for-performance society.\r\n\r\nCityFlySky\r\nCityFlySky\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "If you'd like to create custom cereal boxes, you have many options. You can choose to print your company logo or any other information on the box. Or, you can use images from an online store and create a cereal box design around them. The possibilities are endless! Let us explore some options and ways to create a cereal box custom for your business. A few of these options include full color printing and die-cut window boxes.\r\nFeature Your Logo and Business Name on Custom Cereal Boxes\r\nCustom cereal boxes from USboxprinter.com are an excellent way to package and promote your products. They make your product look appealing and different from the rest. The boxes are also very sturdy, so they will keep the product safe. Custom Die Cut Cereal Boxes can be made of a variety of materials, including cardboard or Kraft. The boxes can be custom-designed to fit your needs, including the size, shape, and design. The company that creates them will do their best to create a product that meets your specifications.\r\nCustomized Die-Cut Window Boxes are great for companies that sell breakfast cereals, snack foods, and snacks. These cereal boxes are customizable and can feature your logo or business name in an attractive way. They can also be printed with cartoon characters or favorite movie characters. The options are endless with these boxes, but you must remember to make them appealing to adults as well. A good cereal box should not only appeal to kids, but also to adults.\r\nAdd Spot UV to Cereal Packaging Boxes for a Better Look and Durability\r\nIf you need more space, consider designing a windowed box. This type of custom cereal box will keep the product safe from dirt and moisture, and it will also protect the contents inside from damage. Die-cut window boxes are often laminated and can resist external damages. You can also add spot UV to cereal packaging boxes for a better look and durability. These custom boxes will protect your product and ensure that it stays fresh for as long as possible.\r\nCereals are in high demand. In the US alone, every second person consumes cereals for breakfast. With increased competition, more brands have come out with new varieties and share shelf space with each other in retail stores. To stand out from the crowd, brands must come up with innovative strategies to differentiate their products from others. Wholesale cereal boxes are an effective way to do this.\r\nConsider Using Glossy Or Foil-Coated Cardboard for Your Cereal Boxes Packaging\r\nIf you're looking for a custom cereal box, you should consider using glossy or foil-coated cardboard. Adding a glossy coating can make your product stand out on retail shelves, while a doughnut truck-style box makes it easier for regular customers to recognize your products. Spot-UV is an excellent add-on for small cereal boxes that is not only attractive but protects them from wear and tear.\r\nThe first thing to remember about cereal boxes packaging is that they can represent your product in a sea of similar items. It's important to stand out in a sea of cereals and other similar products to catch the eye of your target audience. This is where cereal box custom printing comes in handy. It's a great way to advertise your brand while avoiding common mistakes that others make with packaging. We'll help you create a unique, eye-catching package that will stand out from the crowd!\r\nPrinting Should Be Attractive and Satisfying to Your Cereal Box\r\nIn order to be successful, cereal box custom printing should be both attractive to the eye and satisfying to the touch. By choosing a custom-designed box, you can increase the likelihood of consumers recognizing your brand and deciding to buy your products. Choose designs that make your box stand out and attract a large audience. Whether it's a colorful box, a classic box, or a unique box with different themes and textures, you can increase sales by incorporating custom-designed packaging.\r\nYou can use full-color digital or offset printing to customize your own cereal box. You can use complex artwork and a high-quality stock to attract your target market. And when it comes to pricing, YBY Boxes is one of the best companies to work with. And the quality of the stock used for cereal box custom doesn't matter - their shipping is always free, whether your order is large or small.\r\nCustom Cereal Boxes Are a Great Way to Increase Brand Recognition\r\nCustom cereal boxes from USboxprinter.com are a great way to increase brand recognition and establish a memorable impression. While there are many benefits to getting your logo and name printed on custom boxes, the most important goal is brand recognition. Cereals are one of the most popular breakfast foods, so your cereal must be memorable to stand out in the crowd. There are many options when it comes to choosing a custom cereal box, but there are a few things to consider before you start the process.\r\n",

		"description": "\ud83e\ude73 Summary\r\n\r\nThe Watchtower Protocol is a digital public goods project (stack) creating new legos to bring individual verified on-chain reputation of space assets on to web3. The vision is to help manage the crowded orbits & space debris problem and the effect of climate change on it by creating data curation & risk pricing markets of active (and eventually passive) space assets. The project\u2019s aim is to be a bridge to create a space debris market (similar to carbon offsets markets), eventually governed by the WatchtowerDAO. The first product using Watchtower will be insurance - addressing the problem of illiquidity in the in-orbit space insurance market which has seen underwriters leave the sector since 2020.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 About\r\nProblem\r\nAt Watchtower we\u2019re aiming to build a regenerative space economic web3 primitive to bring verified reputation for space assets and help manage the problem of human made space debris spanning since the 1950s & crowded orbits for the coming mega-constellations. We\u2019re starting this by building open-source infrastructure to eventually build sustainability focused financial products and enabling the creation of sustainability first space projects. While there are attempts (SDA, Space Sustainability Index, etc.), these aren\u2019t open-source alternatives but rather permissioned. The closest that has come to this, is TinyGS and the Libre Space Foundation with some success with their SatNOGS project.\r\n\r\nWhy Now\r\nThe rise of space launches by Starlink, Keiper, OneWeb and other mega-constellations lead us to over 100,000 satellites in the next five years if not earlier. This creates crowded orbital corridors where satellites we use everyday (location-based services to studying climate science) are in danger of colliding. This can be equivalent to if not worse than the garbage patch problem in the Pacific Ocean. In addition to this, the rise in CO2 emissions due to climate change, creates conditions for satellites to \u201cskate on ice\u201d (reduced drag). This CO2 can exacerbate the snowballing effect known as Kessler Syndrome. The rise in geopolitical tensions between the United States, Russia and China have made space a warfighting domain again like the 1950s with increased anti-satellite missile tests (ASAT) creating more junk\/debris in our orbital corridors.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f What Is Being Built\r\nWe\u2019re starting with a globally distributed ground network (DGSN) of tracking nodes on Helium with a proof-of-tracking approach to determining a satellite\u2019s state. This enables us to build Laika, a data aggregator marketplace (NFT marketplace aggregator) at its base. Each tracking node hosts its own NFT marketplace providing access to API-endpoints represented as tracking data NFTs.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVision Going Forward\r\nOn top of this, are two layers - a data curation and a risk pricing layer (competitive skin-in-the-game crowdsourcing of data curation and risk pricing). The curation layer solves the underlying problem in space debris - data quality of state estimation - by crowdsourcing data fusion techniques to a global team of data engineers\/curators. The risk pricing layer solves the next problem - risk of collision- by crowdsourcing probability of collision calculation techniques to a global team of data scientists. These are currently napkin designs & associated mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThese legos enable us to create reputation profiles for individual space assets that can be used in a myriad of financial applications such as in-orbit insurance as one example. It both enables sustainable products in the present but also enables sustainable ecosystems going forward to the future. The aim is to drive capital to environmentally-positive projects by unlocking space debris as an asset class and building block within web3 \u2604\ufe0f\ud83c\udf31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWatchtower started out as a risk-pricing marketplace to address inaccuracy in pricing risk of collisions but has gone through multiple pivots after stakeholder interviews, to address not only that but the underlying issue of data quality. The Watchtower stack comprises of:\r\n\r\nLaika: Its purpose is to create a 3-sided data market (consumers, publishers & market makers) to bring efficient pricing via a free markets approach. Tracking nodes publish data to Laika. The curation layer crowd sources data fusion techniques of tracking data. This layer helps ensure data quality of satellite state estimation.\r\nDora: a risk pricing layer with the sole purpose of calculating the probability of collision (Pc) metric for space assets. Dora\u2019s purpose is to crowdsource composable risk models.\u00a0\r\nWatchtower Libraries: Outputs from Laika and Dora help build sustainability focused reputation profiles for individual space assets. Merging these outputs with the data from the spacecraft registry (the Registration Convention) help us create a complete near real-time profile for individual space assets that can access web3 products.

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/6985\/faceless",
		"description": "The payment scheme of the existing blockchain networks such as Ethereum is based on blockchain addresses, which are usually random strings that are hard to memorize and manage. Therefore, it might lead to many inconveniences for the users such as funds being transferred to the wrong address. In contrast, traditional payment is usually based on human-readable identifiers (HRI) instead of random strings, and this is for a good reason. For instance, when you pay your debts to your friends, you want the transaction record to be bound to your identity so that it can serve as proof later that your debt has been paid.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe existing HRI solutions such as ENS usually focus on one specific blockchain ecosystem and fails to incorporate many existing Web 2.0 human-readable identifiers that users are more comfortable using in practice, such as their mobile phone numbers, various social media accounts, email addresses (based on which PayPal systems are built), etc. We believe it is far more interesting to build a cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system that combines the users' existing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 identifiers. A cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system will not only serve the purpose of bringing Web 2.0 users into the Web 3.0 world but also taps into this immense market and helps realize the full potential of Web 3.0.\r\n\r\nAnother limit of existing HRI-based payment solutions is the lack of privacy. This is actually closely tied to another interesting application of Faceless protocol, i.e., regulatory-compliant payment. Due to the explosive growth of Web 3.0 payment and its applications such as DeFi, NFT, etc, traditional financial institution is starting to migrate to Web 3.0. However, in order for the Cryptocurrency market to attract institutional money on a large scale, one has to address its regulatory concerns. The privacy issue is likely to play a central part in the regulatory compliance requirements. Faceless will provide a private payment scheme based on HRI and hence resolve the privacy issue.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur protocol will become a fierce competitor in the sphere of regulatory-compliant payment. In the Web 3.0 world, the HRIs will serve as the basis of regulatory-compliant finance. Faceless satisfies two vital requirements of regulatory compliance: 1. HRI will serve as the basis of regulatory compliance, 2. Our payment solution will be private, which addresses a central issue in any regulatory-compliance requirement. One's HRIs such as mobile numbers or social media accounts can serve as the foundation to implement various regulation-compliant operations such as anti-money laundering. More sophisticated applications such as trusted decentralized finance (DeFi) can also be built on top of our system. For instance, one could build a credit system or lending and borrowing system based on one's HRIs.\r\n\r\nOur scheme is based on a combination of identity-based encryption (IBE) and zero-knowledge proof. Identity-based encryption scheme will allow the users to encrypt the payment under the receiver\u2019s identity instead of random blockchain addresses, and it will also allow the users to manage their multiple HRIs with one single master key, which is a significant usability advantage. Our architecture will introduce a mechanism, which is based on randomized signature, to verify the authenticity of the user identity while protecting the users\u2019 privacy. The verifiable identity will therefore serve as a foundation of regulatory-compliant payment. On the other hand, we will apply the zero-knowledge proof and IBE scheme to protect the users\u2019 financial privacy. We will provide an open-source library to demonstrate the feasibility of our concrete design.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe final product of Faceless protocol will be a layer-2 protocol, which can be deployed on smart contract platforms such as Ethereum. We will potentially introduce a zk-rollup scheme to further improve the scalability of our payment scheme. Our rollup scheme will mainly focus on resolving the conflict between the scalability issue and regulatory compliance requirements.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project has been supported by Web 3.0 grant: https:\/\/github.com\/w3f\/Grants-Program\/blob\/618be8639cc91cfaf779f470444e8c271221030e\/docs\/accepted_grant_applications.md, and we have already delivered milestone 1: https:\/\/github.com\/HeisenbergLin22\/Grant-Milestone-Delivery\/blob\/patch-1\/deliveries\/faceless_milestone1_delivery.md and got accepted by the grant.

		"description": "\r\nWhy are we building an Interspecies Economy?  Because we need to move away from a human-centric economy where resources are used in favor of humans, to a planetary-centric economy that is regenerative by incorporating all stakeholders, human and non-human.\r\n\r\nOur project Plantiverse started out with an exploration of rights for plants, by giving them autonomy. Building on the Rights of Nature movement's gains of independent legal standing for forests and species, we wanted to see if we could get operational, financial, and maybe even civil rights for non-human living beings.\r\n\r\nWe gave Herbie (a herb houseplant) a form of their own autonomy, letting them make certain decisions on their own.\u00a0 Sensors measure Herbie's light, soil moisture, water reservoir, humidity and temperature; which are linked to decisions about mobility; so that Herbie, when in need of water or light, will go to the water source \/ light source.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs Herbie gained decision making power over mobility, we asked ourselves, can non-human beings have economic power?\u00a0 What if Herbie could deliver and sell their own herbs and leaves to people?\u00a0 And if Herbie can sell and \u201cearn\u201d money, could Herbie have a bank account?\u00a0 Could Herbie own things, vote, or even have planetary citizenship?\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut how would that manifest in the real world?\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo we went to work with Herbie, in fact we enabled a family of plants, Minty, Ivy, Ginger and other plants, with sensors.\u00a0 These sensors, in turn, give readings that are then paired with a particular output of an image,\u00a0 Leave colors, for example, indicate water level, \u2026.\r\n\r\nThe rendering, then, becomes a visualization of physiological status of the plant itself, essentially a digital twin, or avatar, of the plant in real life.\r\n\r\nThese visualizations, then were minted in the carbon neutral Solana chain and sold as NFTs or NFTrees.\u00a0 The funds raised via the sales will be directed to sustainable causes.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor millennia, humans have dominated the earth, and dominated species, \u201cdomesticating\u201d plants and animals, and claimed ownership to nature and its resources.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs the consequences of our human centricity impact the earth, what if it is time for non-humans to gain autonomy, and even rights, on par with humans?\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project is about using metaverse, NFT and digital twins as a mechanism for non-humans to gain equal rights so that we can truly establish a fully integrated and diverse approach to earth stewardship, an interspecies metaverse.\r\n\r\nWe think that this is just the beginning and one of a possible self-governed equitable models for a true equitable ecosystem for our planet that is inclusive.\u00a0 Digital twins allow for non-human to have a presence, rights and even economic means in the metaverse that is immutable and traceable.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur unsustainable model of capitalism that is over sourcing our natural resources need to be reinvented. \u00a0 It is time we rethink capitalism, and one of the ways we can level out the playing field is to give plants and other non-human species the same economic power and decision making capabilities that are to their benefits, not ours.\r\n\r\nInterspecies economics might be a means to a more equitable planet, by incorporating all aspects of the complexity of planetary accounting into our consumption model in order to understand how to create a regenerative\u00a0economy.\r\n\r\nWe are currently planning to create the world\u2019s first plant-governed DAO so that plants themselves will have the ability to decide how the funds of these NFTrees should be spent.\u00a0 If the water level is low, then the funds will then go towards water focused initiatives, for example.\r\n\r\nAfter this first iteration of NFTrees, we are now working on the 2nd generation of NFTrees where the trees are now generated in 3D and can be \u201cplanted\u201d via geolocation in the place of your choice and can be viewed via our own augmented reality application of SOFT (Store of Future Things) app.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our future pipeline, we are hoping to extend this project and place sensors in the forest in the same capacity to monitor forestry health and convert those as NFTrees as well.\u00a0 Other initiatives, such as placing sensors in the ocean to monitor ocean health, can then be turned into NFSeas with visualizations of reefs and corals that people can buy and funds can go towards blue initiatives, NFBees for bee health.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the impact NFT could serve as a way to monitor our planetary health via digital twins, and to allow economic autonomy from plants and planetary accounting to be integrated into our economic model.\r\n\r\nOur project is just in the very beginning stages of setting up the foundation of how this could be implemented.\r\n\r\n[upload error]\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "ASC Builder is a GUI (drag-and-drop) smart contracts development software that enables one to add components and specify smart contracts behavior as well as logic with ease, and in turn aid in producing programmatic schematics which in turn could be transpiled to any smart contract development language such as Solidity, Pyteal etc.\r\n\r\nASC Builder's main operation depends solely on DOM element manipulation and attribute & data structure read\/write, which encompasses the use of Nodes, methods and many other components that represent several functionality on a typical smart contract.\r\n\r\nThe system consists of Decisions, Subroutines, Conditionals, Arithmetic operations, etc. that the development process of smart contracts is centered upon. Upon completion of the schematic process of the GUI, the JSON attributes of the DOM elements that have been schematized are then parsed and structured into JSON objects which would serve as a middleman\/intermediary interface through which the end results of the target smart contract programming languages are syntactically formed (in our case Pyteal). The schema can also be imported to another project when required for continued development.\r\n\r\nUpon completion, the project can be deployed to MainNet, TestNet or BetaNet and even Sandbox through the use of third-party nodes such as AlgoExplorer, AlgoNode and PureStake.\r\n\r\nBelow is a link to the documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/ascbuilder-doc.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\r\n\r\nWe have the solution currently in a private development environment, of which updates will be published frequently as they are made.\r\n\r\nWe have made it possible for developers (the community) to be able to submit templates on GitHub for review by the internal team; as well as internally created templates, which can be readily available on the platform and used by others.\r\n\r\nThe repository can be accessed via https:\/\/github.com\/Algoknox\/ASCBuilder_Templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a sample ASC Builder smart contract project in the image above that could in turn be compiled to the PyTEAL smart contract code result below or deployed to the Blockchain seamlessly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe aim at revolutionizing the way in which smart contracts are being developed to make it easier for both developers and non-developers to create and deploy applications on the Algorand Blockchain, paving a way also for audits via the organization and\/or third-party affiliates.\r\n\r\nA lot of support is required from the ecosystem to make this solution a success and we look forward to hearing from the community and working on updates to provide our users with an easy as possible & intriguing user interface\/experience for their work!\r\n\r\n",

To crack the big challenges in human well-being requires a radically different paradigm of health data infrastructure- one that prioritizes individual data ownership while breaking down silos and enabling open data access and aggregation.\r\n\r\nHabitat Health is a peer-to-peer data system, that enables an open, composable yet private health data network. With Habitat Health, we believe we can make health data a collaborative, positive-sum system for all participants.\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\nWe are currently writing the initial specifications of the Habitat Health Protocol, building on the great work at the Decentralized Identity Foundation on DWNs. In parallel, we are building the initial (open-source) implementation in Dart and testing our protocol.\r\n\r\nWe plan to release the full specification along with the reference implementations in 4 months time.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nHabitat Health is currently being built with \u2764\ufe0f by the team at Happily Ever After. Eventually, we expect Habitat Health to have its own ecosystem, branding and open source community!\r\n\r\nWhy Habitat?\r\n1.

		"description": "Gwei Club is a free, open-source platform that allows ENS users to claim and curate their web3 profiles, which display their NFTs, social links, avatar pfp, website, and enables .eth name owners to interact and network with the ENS community.\r\n\r\nWhy we are building it:\r\n\r\nEthereum is the largest blockchain network today and it\u2019s playing a fundamental role in shaping Web3. The increasingly popular Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is primarily used to map human-readable names to wallet addresses, but it offers so much more \u2014 like serving as your Web3 identity. We find the default profile available on .eth.xyz to be fairly basic and a bit underwhelming considering the scope that ENS offers.\r\nWe at Gwei Club feel that ENS is the de facto standard for web3 usernames on Ethereum, and our goal is to build on top of this expansive protocol and leverage the full potential of its community. With this in mind, we\u2019re building a platform where people with .eth names can curate their eb3 profiles, discover fellow ENSers, and interact and network with a group of people who share their belief in the Ethereum ecosystem.\r\nA Gwei Club profile fetches data directly from the chain, which means that users don\u2019t have to create profiles, just claim them.\r\n\r\nYou can do so right now by heading to gweiclub.xyz and entering your .eth name, \r\nOR\r\nsimply search for <your ENS name>.gweiclub.xyz in your browser.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis profile and everything it contains belongs entirely to you. Gwei Club has no control over your data and we don\u2019t ever want to change that. Your Gwei Club profile is decentralized, composable and entirely on-chain. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nGwei Club works on both desktop and mobile, and it currently displays an ENS user\u2019s avatar pfp, their NFT collection, social media links and any website linked to their ENS. Verified users will also receive a blue tick badge next to their .eth names. To get verified, a user has to visit their profile and connect the wallet holding their ENS name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re working on adding a ton of new features in the coming days and we\u2019re constantly looking for community feedback to make sure we build for the people who are going to use our product. \r\n\r\nHere are the features currently in development:\r\n\r\n> Add 'dark mode' functionality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Allow users to share profiles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Give users the option to curate their NFTs in boards according to collections, themes and more categories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Add an NFT as your ENS avatar pfp and edit text records directly from Gwei Club rather than the ens.domains app\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Enable user actions and connections \u2014 users can engage with other profiles (liking, commenting) and add them as connections to grow their network.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 Check out this Loom video for a walkthrough of our upcoming features.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow you can contribute beyond funding:\r\n\r\nGwei Club is for the ENS community, and we want you all to be truly involved in the process. If you have any feedback \u2014 whether it\u2019s something you like, dislike or features would like to see \u2014 or if you want to BUIDL with us, please join our Discord or send us a DM on Twitter. FYI: Gwei Club beta testers and builders are considered to be founding members and will be eligible to mint NFTs from our \u2018OG\u2019 collection (dropping soon!)",

		"description": "About NFA:\u00a0\r\nNon-Fungible Address (NFA) is an experiment that gives identity to your address as an NFT; each NFT resonates with the Ethereum logo, which means it turns your address into an NFT. (It's a generative Art of your eth address, which looks like the ethereum logo.)\r\n\r\nEach address has numbers & alphabet, i.e. it's alphanumeric. We have mapped alphanumeric on the Ethereum logo in such a way that numbers are aligned horizontally (left to right) & alphabets are mapped vertically (top to bottom)\r\n\r\nEach address starts from 0x, and lines are mapped on the points starting from 0x. That means each unique address will have a unique NFT. Ultra RARE!\r\n\r\nUnique address = Unique NFT = Rarest NFT that you can own.\r\n\r\nWhy have we created this?\r\n2021 was a great year for the NFT community and the Web3 ecosystem, NFTs were on the top, and pfp was gaining popularity over the globe and building its value in the market. But it's not something that anyone can relate to it. Some people thought of it as a simple png and jpeg file. So, we came up with an NFA as an identity NFT, which represents your address as an NFT, which also looks like an ethereum logo, and it's generated and stored on-chain completely.\r\n\r\nIt's open source, so anyone can use NFA to build over it.\r\n\r\nPlease follow us on Twitter and check out our Website here!!\r\n\r\n",

A quick video intro here:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is also a very good tool for onboarding friends into Web3:\r\nWithout MyFirstNFT:\r\nspend a lot of time explaining the concepts and knowledge to your friends;\r\nyou might miss some key points, like security, lack of security knowledge can lead to theft of property;\r\nYou need to help them install the wallet on their browser, etc.\r\nWith MyFirstNFT:\r\nSend the MyFirstNFT website link(myfirstnft.info) to them, and answer some questions, if any, done.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to assist more Web3 enthusiasts in easily understanding and learning Web3 concepts and knowledge, allowing them to enter the Web3 world quickly and safely.\r\n\r\nThis project was started by Bruce and built by the LXDAO community for almost two months. We have 17 core contributors and over 30 contributors who brought excellent ideas, feedback, and suggestions. And everyone can discuss the content in our forum (https:\/\/forum.lxdao.io\/c\/projects\/001-mfnft\/14) and contribute to ensuring the content is updated and cover most of the key points.\r\n\r\nWhy did we embark on this project? Because many newcomers to Web3 are confused and helpless, there are too many concepts and knowledge to learn and the risk of theft if not done correctly. There are many tutorials and documents on the market, but they are not very systematic and must be summarised and organized by themselves, and many concepts are difficult to understand, so we thought, why not create a comprehensive tutorial that is simple to understand? In addition to concepts, we have security knowledge, which is very important in the Web3 world, we also provide how to DYOR section, and we also provide a free mint NFT function, so the combination of theory and practice can help newbies enter the Web3 world faster.\r\n\r\nWe would like to apply for grants to continue optimizing and promoting this project, such as adding more languages, improving the interactive experience (especially the mobile version), and optimizing the content to make it more understandable, in the hopes of assisting more people who are interested in Web3.\r\n\r\nWe are also planning to make the second version of this project in the community. The topic is on our community forum https:\/\/forum.lxdao.io\/t\/the-next-version-of-myfirstnft\/66. In short, will add content for developers to build their first NFT project and improve the UI\/UX to make it more structured and easy to track their progress. The grants will be really helpful for LXDAO to keep maintaining this public good!",

		"description": "FrontierDAO\u00a0\r\n\r\n'Bringing Fusion Power To The People. \r\n...And The People To Fusion Power.' \r\n\r\nAre you ready for clean, abundant, cheap energy on Planet Earth? \r\n\r\nSo are we! \r\n\r\nThis is what FrontierDAO is working towards. We believe that fusion energy is the key to clean, abundant, cheap energy for all people on Earth. And we believe that people just like you and me can fund this technology transition to clean energy.\r\n\r\nWhy does clean, abundant, cheap energy matter? Well, look around you. Climate change, with its droughts, floods and fires, is wreaking havoc on human and wildlife populations, not to mention the planet's ecosystem. \r\n\r\nImagine a world where even the most remote communities have electricity, heating, sanitation and clean water. This is the promise of nuclear fusion energy (not to be mistaken with nuclear fission). \r\n\r\nOur DAO so far is bootstrapped. We need people power. And we are committed to grow with integrity. This means paying people a fair and equitable salary for the work they do. This grant will go towards paying the salaries of up to 8 full-time DAO staffers. \r\n\r\nI am the co-Founder of FrontierDAO. As a female founder, and someone who grew up on a small Pacific Island, I greatly appreciate the need for clean energy and for people - anyone -  to be able to participate in creating the kind of world they want to live in. \r\n\r\nDemocratization of energy is our mission. \r\n\r\nDarsh is a space and science communications expert and graduate of SpaceKind program. He graduated with a Bachelor's in Management Studies in Finance & PGP Software Development (Cybersecurity). He is currently pursuing a Master's in Commerce Advanced Accountancy.  He is the Project Manager for FrontierRegistry, the DAO's scientific publishing platform. To see what FrontierRegistry is about, please visit our FAQS & Projects page. \r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n*We are included in the #quadraticfrens #DEI grants collection list.  Easy One-Click Donate to all of us! \r\n$1 makes a big difference with #QuadraticFunding matching grants. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is #DeSci - 5 Minute Audio \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease read more below for INFO on fusion energy, funding public goods and why Fusion Energy is Now! \r\n\r\nImage: Tokamak nuclear fusion reactor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt FrontierDAO our \u2018funding the public goods\u2019 sights are set high. We aim for nothing less than the democratization of energy.\u00a0But not just any energy source. Our goal is to help catalyze the commercialization and deployment of nuclear fusion energy - the most clean, abundant, cheap source of energy potentially available to our planet and its people.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\n\r\nTable of Contents \r\n\r\nSummary of How Funds Will Be Used\r\nWhat is Fusion Energy? #DeSci? \r\nHow is it key to unlocking a Clean Energy Future for Planet Earth? \r\nFrontierDAO is committed to Democratization of (Clean) Energy \r\nWhy we believe funding fusion energy innovation is a public good\r\nPublic Awareness campaigns for Fusion Energy potential, Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Science\r\nPresentation Video & Contact, Links\r\nWhitepaper on Science and Fusion Energy Research by FrontierDAO\r\n\r\n\r\nAt FrontierDAO we catalyze and incubate emerging technology through research, Test & Evaluation and, ultimately, commercialization. Our focus is on the fields of fusion energy, space exploration and science\/ technologies that mitigate climate impacts. \r\n\r\nFunding from this grant will be used towards paying the salaries of at least 8 Full-time core DAO contributors (staff). A minimum salary for these advanced skill sets is $50K each.  \r\nThe foundational skill areas we need are DevOps, Legal, Operations, Comms\/Marketing, Biz Dev & Project Management, Systems Architecting & Community, Web3 & DAO building, Events & PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional funding will be used towards \r\nAcquiring RegA status to allow for the widest possible membership and benefits (i.e. not just accredited investors)\r\nPublic Awareness campaigns: (Media, Events, Virtual, In-Person, Educational)\r\nFor the crypto-Web3  community on What is fusion? And the democratization of energy?\r\nFor the scientific\/engineering\/academic\/research communities on how blockchain and Web3 tooling can serve them efficiently and beneficially.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time fusion energy has gotten a 'bad rap.' It's been described as always being '30 years away.' Huge government funded projects such as ITER.org in the South of France, which represents a cooperative consortium of 35 nations, are what most are familiar with in terms of fusion energy research. ITER is 35 nations all contributing funding and brain power to realizing the Holy Grail of nuclear fusion energy. Then there is the MIT spin-off, Common Wealth Fusion Systems in Massachusetts that has gotten $2B in funding so far. \r\n\r\nThese examples illustrate why we believe so strongly that #DeSci, decentralized science, is the right approach to have for fusion energy research today. Why? Because by opening up this research to the widest number of collaborators we believe it will catalyze innovation through a competitive, yet collaborative, scientific process. It will also allow for wider sources of funding of this breakthrough technology. \r\n\r\nIf a million (or more!) people were given permission to 'invest' in their clean energy future, would they? We believe they would, if given even half the chance. \r\n\r\n\r\nimage courtesy cointelegraph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, at Lawrence Livermore National Lab's National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California, an extraordinary breakthrough has been achieved in the past year. The breakthrough is known as Lawson's Criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWSON'S CRITERION & SUSTAINABLE NET FUSION ENERGY\r\n\r\nLawson's Criterion is the point at which a fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining. To explain further, the researchers at NIF directed a high-powered laser beam at a capsule of hydrogen and heated it up to 18,000 times the heat of the sun. This hydrogen atom fused and released the equivalent of 10 quadrillion watts of power...or 1.3 megajoules of energy. \r\n\r\nAnd the even more extraordinary thing is that the researchers have analyzed the data over the course of nearly a year, now, and concluded that the reaction wasn't temporary, but self-sustaining. This means that when the same conditions are met, the fusion reaction will lead to another and then a next and a next in a self-sustaining, self-perpetuating virtuous circle of clean, abundant, cheap energy. \r\n\r\nAll of a sudden fusion energy is no longer 30 years away. The most informed analysts now predict that we will be seeing the net energy output of fusion energy as soon as 2024. And from there, commercialization and widescale deployment will follow. \r\n\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY ALREADY PILING IN TO FUSION ENERGY STARTUPS \r\n\r\nIn July 2022, Chevron and Google each put $100M into a nuclear fusion energy startup. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have both backed British Columbia-based General Fusion. Investments in fusion energy soared by $2.8B in the past 12 months alone (as of July 2022 writing). \r\n\r\nThat represents a total investment in fusion energy R&D of $4.8B, up from a total of just $2B 12 months ago. Of that total, only $117M is public funding. The rest is private funding by the likes of billionaires and billion $$ corporations. (*These calculations exclude ITER.org Tokamak in Southern France).Congress\u2019s recent Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spending bill, $370B was included for energy and climate spending.\r\n\r\nOf that, only about $270M was earmarked for the fusion energy industry, \u2018mostly for construction\u2019 according to the Fusion Industry Association.\u00a0So, can the everyday retail investor gain exposure to this promising technology? \r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nAt the very least you have to be an accredited investor in order to get in on any of these potential funding rounds. There are no RegCF funding rounds for the everyday investor for fusion energy startups. And none planned so far as we know.\r\n\r\nBrief Explanation of Fusion Energy & How It Works \r\n\r\n\"Fusion occurs when two light atoms bond together, or fuse, to make a heavier one. As described by Albert Einstein's famous E=mc2 equation: The total mass of the new atom is less than that of the two that formed it; the \"missing\" mass is given off as energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImage courtesy Renato Perillo \r\n\r\nThe fusion energy industry is projected to be a $40Trillion dollar industry..And some estimates state that it is set to disrupt the $1T per year global energy market; Once breakthrough is achieved at significant levels (referring to when more energy is output than input in a nuclear fusion reactor) this clean, abundant, cheap energy source is set to potentially replace most other sources of energy on the planet. \r\n\r\nThere is little to no radioactive waste produced from nuclear fusion energy, either.\r\n\r\n:\"Nuclear fusion energy is pretty much the opposite of nuclear fission energy.\"\r\n\r\nAs an Impact DAO, FrontierDAO is positioning itself so that its members both help catalyze this race to clean, abundant fusion energy deployment and also share in the potential profits that will inevitably come from it.\u00a0Imagine if Chevron, Exxon, AramCo or BP were DAOs?\u00a0\r\n\r\nClean, abundant, cheap energy for the planet\u2019s people is already a disruptor in itself. Electricity, hot water, internet, mobile phone rechargers, sanitation, cooking, heating for even the most remote communities on our planet is what this will mean. But it doesn\u2019t stop there - issues like fresh water sourcing are also largely solved when the prohibitive energy costs of water desalination become moot when nuclear fusion energy is used as an energy source for the process.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe closest comparison to a fellow DeSci DAO would be VitaDAO. What Vita is doing for Longevity Research, we aim to do for nuclear fusion energy. We are structuring so that IP that we invest in as a DAO, once commercialized and monetized, will pay back into the DAO Treasury. \r\n\r\nOur purpose is to:\r\n\r\nSupport nuclear fusion R&D, Test &Evaluation to the point where it\u2019s commercialized and deployed globally.\r\n\r\nHelp provide the planet a clean, abundant, cheap energy source thus rendering the climate change conversation moot going forward.\r\n\r\nHelp grow the personal wealth of our DAO membership (open to all)\u00a0while increasing the DAO\u2019s treasury.The DAO\u2019s treasury will be used to further support innovative technologies and fusion energy deployment.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrontierDAO was created in September 2021. As a female co-founder, I helped set up and deploy FrontierDAO on Aragon as a DAO in January 2022. Thus far we are bootstrapped. We are seeking grant funding from Gitcoin for these immediate needs:\u00a0\r\n\r\nPublic information education and awareness\u00a0with an emphasis on Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. \r\n\r\nAt FrontierDAO we face two challenges in our communications strategy:\u00a0\u00a0The scientific, engineering and climate change communities who are our natural target communities tend not to be native crypto or Web3 people. So explaining Web3 and onboarding these communities as DAO members is a steep learning curve and\/or point of friction that we must work hard to scale.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Web3 and native crypto communities are fully conversant in DAO-speak and DeFi concepts, but there is generally a misconception about Nuclear Fusion energy, often mistaken for Nuclear Fission energy. This, too, poses a steep messaging hurdle to what is otherwise a natural target community.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMilestone 1\r\n\r\nOnboard 1000 members to the DAO who support clean energy and who believe that fusion energy is a potential solution to climate challenges.\\Successful onboarding of community will necessitate a full-time core DAO team. We already have necessary DAO tooling in place, or readily deployable, such as Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, and DAO smart contracts enabling governance on our Aragon dashboard, etc. We aim to onboard\u00a0the first 1000 DAO members in the next 6 months, all committed to supporting fusion energy research and eventual deployment on a global scale. \r\n\r\nOur vision is to scale this to a million or more members as fusion energy builds traction in the coming years. To achieve this, we will require a fully committed core DAO contributor team with requisite skill sets.\\\r\n\r\nMilestone 2: \r\n\r\nHave the budget to pay 8 full-time DAO contributors who have the required skill sets in DevOps, Legal, Comms, Marketing & Community, Engineering, Science, Project Management, Biz Dev. As we bridge into being an Investment DAO (as well as a Research DAO), we need to remain compliant with SEC and U.S.\/international investment laws. A\u00a0part of this intended grant is to be used for legal fees and compliance structuring in a way that allows us to onboard the maximum number of members. The structure we seek will allow the DAO Treasury to pay out to the membership, over the coming decade and longer, shares in any and all of the accrued wealth.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMilestone 3: \r\n\r\nDAO structuring, tokenization and governance that is fully compliant with US regs. \r\n\r\nIn November of 2021, I wrote a paper and published it as a NFT on Mirror.xyz. It is titled, \"Why Science, Why Blockchain, Why A DAO Now?\"\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/mirror.xyz\/0x4A35674727c44cf4375d80C6171281Ba2f764213\/oQ8iKsOm3Hb05pUA3oV_GFyiyqcmJJk6cFnwudXsbP8\r\n\r\nThis paper was published as a NFT at the very start of the #DeSci trend, but it clearly explains the initial vision for FrontierDAO and how science and innovation can be re-tooled using Web3. We also have our WhitePaper on FrontierDAO.xyz which dives even more deeply into our purpose and mission.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe aim to democratize clean, abundant, cheap energy. And we want our members to do good for themselves,  their loved ones and offspring while doing good for the planet and its future generations.\r\n\r\nWhitePaper @ FrontierDAO.xyz \r\n\r\n1 Minute Video Presentation \r\nhttps:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1PSrDHQE-lTVWapsJ-DZjGE91Vutv_Yn5\/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nLinktr.ee\/FrontierDAO\r\n\r\nQuestions?

		"description": "Newschain is an experimental web3 portal to democratize news publication and distribution.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDemocratization\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe envision a platform where anyone can publish an article, and own it as a digital asset.\u00a0Current newspapers and social media platforms let you publish content as long as they could profit from its digital asset (a web post or a story), by publishing advertising on it, or by gathering your private information.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nNewschain aims to create an environment where you can publish your content and actually own its digital asset. Hence, profits and responsibilities derived from it would be entirely yours.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNews Distribution\r\n\u00a0\r\nCurrent newspapers and social media have\u00a0black box\u00a0algorithms that select which news are relevant for you. Newspapers rely on this to pursue political or business agendas, while social media aim to maintain engagement and optimize ads revenue. Therefore, a simple question such as \u201cwhy am I offered these articles?\u201d has no verifiable answer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn this sense, our goal is to distribute the news that are relevant for most readers. So, instead of getting the latest news from a centralized entity, each reader runs a\u00a0transparent\u00a0algorithm that fetches the articles that were recently most read.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNewschain = News in the Blockchain\r\n\u00a0\r\nBoth democratization and transparent distribution are challenging goals that we experimentally tried to tackle with blockchain technology. In the remainder of the article we will explain how this technology provides some key features that may help achieving the goals, as well as the brand new questions that are brought to the table.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPublishing an article to the Blockchain\r\n\u00a0\r\nModern blockchains, such as Ethereum, provide mechanisms that allow uploading content to the chain different from pure transactions such as \u201cAlice transfers Bob two bitcoins\u201d [1]. We have created a protocol that allows anyone to upload an article (namely formatted text, a location and images links) to an Ethereum blockchain.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNewschain as a system can be thought of as a protocol for uploading news + a browser script to find them.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce an article is published through our protocol, anyone with internet access can find the article in its raw version as a blockchain transaction. For instance, the introduction article is actually published as a blockchain transaction\u2026\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhy use the blockchain for sharing news?\r\n\u00a0\r\nPersistence.\u00a0Blockchain data structures provide guarantees that once a block is added to the chain, it shouldn\u2019t be erased, at least for a reasonable amount of time. In our scenario, this means that once the article is published it cannot be erased from the chain.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHosting & Reach.\u00a0Blockchain nodes are distributed around the globe (or should be) and provide reasonable quality of service to our purposes. If you can make or read the transactions to Ethereum, that means you can read and publish newschain articles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nProof of intellectual property.\u00a0Articles are published by ethereum accounts that can prove their authorship with cryptographic mechanisms.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nOwn your article.\u00a0\u00a0You can think of an article publication transaction as a piece of a server host capacity that you buy permanently. Once you get it, we envision features such as renting your article advertising space, receiving donations directly from your readers, or even selling your article in full. Although these are not present in this first version, we would love to hear your thoughts about it!\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nBenefits of publishing an article to the Newschain\r\n\u00a0\r\nSharing.\u00a0\u00a0Once an article is published, we immediately assign it an unique identifier that can be used to share the publication using Newschain. Any reader can use it to fetch the contents of the publication in the blockchain and render it locally. A remarkable difference with web2.0 platforms is that ours does not host or hold any information. Newschain can be thought of as a browser that anyone can use to fetch and discover articles.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDiscovery.\u00a0\u00a0We also provide a home where articles that are most read, by location, are displayed. The intention is that Newschain home works as a news portal with the articles that are loaded in the blockchain.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow does Newchain work?\r\n\u00a0\r\nNewschain protocol.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe core of the Newschain lives in the blockchain as a solidity smart contract (repo). There are essentially three mechanisms in this alpha version: The publishing, the gas sharing, and the viewing counting. Essentially, the publishing and gas sharing does pretty much it (register an article and share gas for interacting with the platform), while the viewing counting offers a PoW mechanism to estimate viewership. For technical details please refer to the repository documentation, as it may change rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNewschain browser (GUI).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe browser is in fact just a script, written in React, that looks up the published articles in the Gorli Ethereum testnet. Hence, no content is hosted by any server (other than ethereum nodes).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhy is it\u00a0experimental?\r\n\u00a0\r\nBeing the first web3 platform for open news publication and sharing (to our knowledge). We have several research questions that would like to answer with this first version:\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo what extent does a web3 platform such as Newschain (that use Blockchain for hosting information) scale?\u00a0\r\nWhat is the performance (render time, load Time, etc) of the platform? How does it fare against a standard web 2.0 platform? In particular, how do different (ethereum) networks fare between each other in terms of performance when rendering Newschain content?\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDoes the viewership counting mechanism provide benefits in scalability? (one of its goals). How does it fare against traditional viewership mechanisms reported in web 2.0 approaches?\r\nHow does our upgradeability contract mechanism perform in terms of platform stability, and web3 development in general, as we aim to allow contract upgrades as well as gui upgrades, and backwards compatibility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is next?\r\n\u00a0\r\nIdentity: provide a mechanism (ideally 3rd party) to register an account identity (for ease of author recognition)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDesign article operations protocols (edit, renting advertising, selling, receiving donations)\u00a0\r\nAnti bot mechanisms: Design mechanisms to certify human reading of news (captcha, random riddles).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nGather feedback (from github, gitcoin, etc)\r\nTest IPFS performance for serving Newschain browser script, as well as for content uploading.\u00a0\r\nImprove the half-baked GUI and ideally open the source code.\u00a0\r\nTest other gas relaying options (e.g sharing a PoS in polygon)\u00a0\r\nExplore alternatives to infura gateways (e.g a light geth client)\u00a0\r\nShow the user stats in the platform participation (votes, reads, publications)\r\nShow general stats in platform participation (#publications)\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin us in the road for democratizing news media! \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1535942432193490944",

Although these are not present in this first version, we would love to hear your thoughts about it!\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nBenefits of publishing an article to the Newschain\r\n\u00a0\r\nSharing.\u00a0\u00a0Once an article is published, we immediately assign it an unique identifier that can be used to share the publication using Newschain. Any reader can use it to fetch the contents of the publication in the blockchain and render it locally. A remarkable difference with web2.0 platforms is that ours does not host or hold any information. Newschain can be thought of as a browser that anyone can use to fetch and discover articles.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDiscovery.\u00a0\u00a0We also provide a home where articles that are most read, by location, are displayed. The intention is that Newschain home works as a news portal with the articles that are loaded in the blockchain.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow does Newchain work?\r\n\u00a0\r\nNewschain protocol.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe core of the Newschain lives in the blockchain as a solidity smart contract (repo). There are essentially three mechanisms in this alpha version: The publishing, the gas sharing, and the viewing counting. Essentially, the publishing and gas sharing does pretty much it (register an article and share gas for interacting with the platform), while the viewing counting offers a PoW mechanism to estimate viewership. For technical details please refer to the repository documentation, as it may change rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNewschain browser (GUI).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe browser is in fact just a script, written in React, that looks up the published articles in the Gorli Ethereum testnet. Hence, no content is hosted by any server (other than ethereum nodes).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhy is it\u00a0experimental?\r\n\u00a0\r\nBeing the first web3 platform for open news publication and sharing (to our knowledge). We have several research questions that would like to answer with this first version:\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo what extent does a web3 platform such as Newschain (that use Blockchain for hosting information) scale?\u00a0\r\nWhat is the performance (render time, load Time, etc) of the platform? How does it fare against a standard web 2.0 platform? In particular, how do different (ethereum) networks fare between each other in terms of performance when rendering Newschain content?\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDoes the viewership counting mechanism provide benefits in scalability? (one of its goals). How does it fare against traditional viewership mechanisms reported in web 2.0 approaches?\r\nHow does our upgradeability contract mechanism perform in terms of platform stability, and web3 development in general, as we aim to allow contract upgrades as well as gui upgrades, and backwards compatibility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is next?\r\n\u00a0\r\nIdentity: provide a mechanism (ideally 3rd party) to register an account identity (for ease of author recognition)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDesign article operations protocols (edit, renting advertising, selling, receiving donations)\u00a0\r\nAnti bot mechanisms: Design mechanisms to certify human reading of news (captcha, random riddles).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nGather feedback (from github, gitcoin, etc)\r\nTest IPFS performance for serving Newschain browser script, as well as for content uploading.\u00a0\r\nImprove the half-baked GUI and ideally open the source code.\u00a0\r\nTest other gas relaying options (e.g sharing a PoS in polygon)\u00a0\r\nExplore alternatives to infura gateways (e.g a light geth client)\u00a0\r\nShow the user stats in the platform participation (votes, reads, publications)\r\nShow general stats in platform participation (#publications)\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin us in the road for democratizing news media! \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1535942432193490944",

This will convert research works into real world solutions.\r\n\r\nBy creating a virtual, immersive and persistent scientific environment, we will\u00a0facilitate meaningful human interactions between scientists and funders while eliminating a centralised control. \r\nFunders will have a pool of research work to choose from while scientist will have the right funding to convert ideas to solutions.\r\nMERITS OF DECENTRALISED SCIENCE OVER TRADITIONAL SCIENCE: \r\n\r\n1) Scientists collaborate with peers from all over the globe in dynamic teams. Unlike traditional scientific research where centralised organisations limit collaborations. \r\n\r\n2) Scientists will be able to share virtual laboratory services with anyone in the world. This is unlike traditional science where sharing is limited. \r\n\r\n3) Scientists will earn rewards in Transhuman Coin (our native token) for peer-reviewing work. This is not the case with traditional scientific where peer-review works are unpaid. \r\n\r\n4) Sharing all of the research procedure, including the data from unsuccessful efforts, by having all steps on-chain. This is different from the traditional publication bias which makes researchers more likely to share experiments that had successful results. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking for funding to commence development of the Transhumanist DeSci project which will bring the longevity field closer to blockchain.\r\n",

Fortunately, no students were in the building at the time. The schoolhouse suffered major damage severely compromising its structural integrity.

I thank you for your support as we continue discovering, sharing + building solutions.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\ttldr: Help fund the publication + distribution of Provable Democracy, a free ebook. We'll also be producing open-source code to make concepts come to life.\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tProblem: How can we evolve Democracy through Web3?\r\n\t\r\n\tProblem Narrative\u00a0\r\n\tWhen we think of the algorithms running web3, we think of PoW, PoS, DPoS. These are what keeps us in enough agreement over network state that we place trust in our financial transactions. But are these algorithms applicable to a social perspective?\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tI would say no, not really. And they don\u2019t have to be. Producing blocks that secure a state across a network is different than deciding on legal policy that secures the life, liberty and property of a nation. They show the technology is here + accepted, but who will develop the social systems that will affect our grandkids? What groups will implement them? And what is a social system anyway?\r\n\t\r\n\tThe shining social system is Democracy, a concept that has changed with the times from clay pots to representation. We are no longer bound by time in communication, or distance in representation, so it stands to reason that we\u2019re already going through a revolution in democracy, from Gitcoin, to DPoS, to DAOs.\r\n\t\r\n\t\u00a0Democracy is often linked to politics and governance, but today, some of the most impactful decisions are our interactions that drive the algorithms that determine what content is shown to hungry minds scrolling their phones. If only we knew how these algorithms made their decisions.\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tSolution: Define key primitives + functions needed for democratic systems to develop in unique ways.\r\n\t\r\n\tSolution Narrative\u00a0\r\n\tNow we have the opportunity to explore systems and ways to solve the same problem: Human Collaboration towards Common Desires. We have the time to step back and look at how we are interacting, and where our information comes from. We have the leeway to re-define what is the bare-minimum level of democracy we accept for each type of system (social media, music playlists, running a country).Theses minimums are, in part, the primitives that must be defined and agreed upon for any fair system to develop.\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tFor just one primitive, personhood, many independent solutions exist, ranging from KYC platforms, to social verification solutions such Proof of Humanity, to biometric options like you use to unlock your phone. But verifying a person is only one aspect of democracy to explore. Supporting this grant means more exploration, and more solutions in-code.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tHow your support drives change.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI love writing about biomimetic tokenomic systems and structuring data primitives, but if no one reads it, what did I write? And if I am making a public good of my own ideology, who does that really serve?\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy goal with this project isn\u2019t to preach all my great ideas. it\u2019s to first create the common knowledge that new Web3 democracies exist, and show how to integrate them. To accomplish this mission, we need to share the working democratic ideas that reveal the functional inefficiencies in current power structures, including existing DAO structures. 40% of your ETHergy transfer will be used on branding and downloadable media information (PDFs, short video, etc) to educate, and ensure the code hits.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd code is important. The remaining grant will be used to fund writing and curating code. Awesome Repo will swell with DAOs and DHOs and DXOs or whatever is next. The next wave of developers and decision makers on a global scale are granted opportunity to discover and build software that makes society run smoother. (or so we hope)\r\n\r\nI am grateful for any donation you are able to give, considering all the GR15 ReFi good causes.\r\n\t\r\n\tPrevious Open Source code\u00a0by grant proposer\r\n\t- Effective Collective: github.com\/dougbutner\/effective-collective\r\n\t- Biomimetic Contracts: github.com\/dougbutner\/beta-pseudo\/tree\/main\/real-contracts\u00a0\r\n\t- Tribe (DHO): github.com\/dougbutner\/tribe.cxc.world\r\n\r\n\tPrevious relevant papers \r\n\t- Web 4 (Source material for Provable Democracy eBook): https:\/\/github.com\/dougbutner\/web-4\r\n\t- Purple Paper: bit.ly\/PRPpaper1\u00a0\r\n\t- Mapps Paper: bit.ly\/MAPPSpaper\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a proposed structure for a simple biokey generator.

This battle between cold-facts and emotional narrative won\u2019t be solved by a shiny PDF. It will be solved by the systems that develop when we continue to dialogue, develop tools, primitives, and protocols, and publish solutions.

		"description": "Abstract\r\n\t\tDigital service providers (DSPs) often act as curators, who grabbed most of the user's interests through channel advantages. In order for everyone to freely choose their role (creator or curator or delegator or developer) and benefit from it in ownership economy, we introduce TheBards, a fully decentralized NFTs curation economy protocol built with public blockchain infrastructure and other decentralized technologies.\r\n\r\n1. Mission\r\n\r\n\t\tPromoting the efficient and synchronized circulation of information and value, so as to mint the value of everyone.\r\n\r\n2. Motivations\r\n\t2.1. We are Creatures of Stories\r\n\r\n\tYuval Noah Harari's best-seller book, \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind[1],\u201d claims that gossip, based on judgments, began our rule of the planet. Before we began gossiping with other Homo sapiens, we were merely another mammal in the food chain.\r\n\tGossiping empowered us to bond with others socially, create friendships and even hierarchies, allowing us to cooperate while gaining an edge on the animal kingdom. Gossip is one of the unheralded foundations of our species and its survival, Harari concludes.\r\n\t\u201cSocial cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction,\u201d he writes in the book. \u201cIt is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bisons. It\u2019s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest and who is a cheat.\u201d\r\n\tHe conjectures that the cognitive demands to socialize in groups drove the growth of the human brain, eventually leading to language and other activities that allowed us to organize more effectively for survival. One of these attributes that emerged from greater socialization and larger brains, was storytelling \u2014 the ability to construct imagined realities. Storytelling allowed us to develop beliefs, narratives, and other purely intellectual constructs, such as religions, companies, nations, and liberal humanism, which furthered our social and organizational capabilities. Harari uses the example of a limited liability corporation \u2014 a completely imaginary entity that nevertheless organizes the work of many people, carrying out a mission across time and space because so many people accept the corporation to be as real as a tree or stone. Other animals do not have LLCs but instead live in the tangible, physical world.\r\n\tThroughout history, we listen to stories and create our own stories all the time.\u00a0We organize things and individuals effectively through stories. We create family stories to build blood ties, company stories to capture value, and religious stories to build beliefs.\u00a0\r\n\tIn general, we are creatures of stories, who reach a consensus through stories, and will continue to tell stories and tell them better.\r\n\r\n\t2.2. The Power of Stories in Decision Making\r\n\r\n\tNassim Taleb suggests the Andrey Nikolayevich Rule[5], which says that in real-world economic life we are faced with a lot of information that is costly to obtain, costly to store, and costly to manipulate and retrieve. As a result, we simplify: we reduce the dimensions of life through the use of stories.\r\n\tAccording to Taleb, stories help us to make the world \u201cless random than it actually is,\u201d and they can fit in with our incessant drive for sense-making.[7] Chater & Loewenstein similarly posit that our hardwiring for stories is based upon our dislike for entropy or disorder.[7] We try to organize our lives into narratives, to force sense into the randomness around us.\r\n\tSo, there is good reason to believe that we use stories in the way we think, and decision making too[5].\r\nTherefore, the ultimate decision to purchase may not be based merely on the specific features of the goods and services, but rather the imagined sequence of events as a whole. In other words, our choices often rely on narratives.\r\n\tThis is arguably what GoPro does so well. They don\u2019t sell you the features of their cameras. They sell you the swashbuckling, risk-taking, adventurous lifestyle narrative that accompanies their cameras.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\t2.3. The Curation is Storytelling\r\n\r\n\tCuration is care over objects or, in Merriam-Webster\u2019s case, care over words traditionally. Jacob Horn, the Founder of Zora provided a new definition: curation is the act of creating context[2]. This definition is a bit complicated and not elegant. Curation is essentially storytelling, by which we deliver value and build consensus, just as we humans do all the time. That is, by organizing things in a certain form, trying to convey a certain information or value, so as to form a consensus among the crowd, which is no different from organizing words to tell a story.\r\n\tAmazon curates thousands of products and tells a story about e-commerce; Facebook curates our social relationships and tells the story of social networks; Google curates information and tells the story of search engines. Here are a few examples of big Internet companies. In fact, all companies in the world are trying to tell their stories by curating their products and services. Once our minds accept their stories, we enter into their stories, just like an ignorant moth falling into a spider's web, which cannot be easily eliminated. This may be the deep-seated reason for monopoly.\r\n\tWe don't want to fall into the stories weaved by the big internet companies and be sold to ad agencies for profit, they are actually taking advantage of us and yet we get very little or nothing.\r\nIn web3, data is publicly accessible, decentralized curation is still needed and becomes more important and valuable. We may tell our own stories by curating who we are, what we have, and what we do.\r\n\r\n3. Problems\r\n\r\n\tWe see a lot of special challenges that creators and curators are facing today.\r\n\t\r\n\t\u25cf Digital service providers (DSPs) often act as curators, they decide what users will see, thus selling our attention as a product to advertisers.\r\n\t\u25cf Incomplete rights ownership data often prevents content creators and curators from getting paid; instead, earnings accumulate in digital service providers and rights societies.\r\n\t\u25cf There are layers of middlemen and significant time delay involved in payments to creators and curators.\r\n\t\u25cf Publishing rights are complicated and opaque, with no incentives for the industry to make rights data public and accurate.\r\n\t\u25cf Licensing issues prevent DSPs and content from being accessible worldwide.\r\n\r\n4. Solution\r\n\r\n\tWe believe that curation is trying to tell a story about someone's work, life, entertainment, skills, etc. TheBards is a Creator + Curation + NFT economy system. For simplicity, hereafter collectively referred to as the curation economy. Smart contracts specify the interaction between the four roles (like creator, curator, delegator, developer) and the fair distribution of profits in the system.\u00a0\r\n\tIt is worth noting that we regard user profiles, feeds and Dapps as curations, so delegator can also stake TBT to the above objects at the same time.\r\n\r\n\t4.1. Curations\r\n\r\n\tCurations will be minted into NFTs, which can be collected and pledged by anyone to share benefits. There are the following curatorial types:\r\n\r\n\t\u25cf Self curation: Presented as a CV or profile NFT that explains who we are, what we have and what we do.\r\n\t\u25cf Single curation: Expressed as basic posts, such as microblogs, articles, audio, video, etc., used to show the creator's gigs, ideas, work, life, knowledge, tastes, etc., which will be minted as NFTs by default, so they can be collected by fans and used as creator's soulband items.\r\n\t\u25cf Combined curation: Various organic combinations of content are also a way of curation, just like the mutual achievement of video and music in tiktok, which will produce a magical chemical reaction.\r\n\t\u25cf Protfolio curation: Equally and purposefully combine content into a list, such as a jazz playlist.\r\n\t\u25cf Feed curation: Featured or specific types of information streams, such as news, funny videos, audio novels, etc.\r\n\r\n\t4.2. Stakeholders\r\n\r\n\tIn our curation economy system, including the following stakeholders, our protocols will define the interaction between them and the distribution of benefits.\r\n\r\n\t\u25cf Creator: Creators publish microblogs, articles, pictures, audios, videos, Q&A, etc. as NFTs.\r\n\t\u25cf Curator: Curators are also creators. However, They try to combine different elements to tell a story. Like a literati combining words into prose, like a musician combining notes into a symphony. It is worth noting that the main curation method of this article is combined curation, protfdio curation, and feed curation, excludes the other two special curation types. The TheBards rewards Curators that tell a unique and valuable story earn a share of sale fees of NFTs and rewards.\r\n\t\u25cf Delegator: Delegator are critical to the decentralized curation economy. They use their knowledge or intuition to assess and signal on the curations.\u00a0Delegator are economically incentivized to siganl early. By signalling on a curation, you will earn a share of all the curation share revenue that this curation generates. x% of all curation share revenue goes to the delegators pro-rata to their delegation shares.\u00a0\r\n\t\u25cf Developer: Create a feed curation or use existing data or feeds in a dapp.\r\nWe are familiar with creator and developer. Next, we will focus on delegator and curator.\r\n\t\r\n\t4.3. Delegator\r\n\r\n\tEach curation has a bonding curve[3] on which delegation shares are minted when a user delegate (i.e., \"stake\") TBT to the curve. Each curation\u2019s bonding curve is unique. The bonding curves are architected so that the price to mint a delegation share on a curation increases linearly, over the number of shares minted.\r\nIn general, a bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between token supply and asset price. In the specific case of content curation, the price of each curation share increases with each token invested and the price of each share decreases with each token sold.\r\n\tDelegator make the curation economy system efficient and end users know that a curation is good to focus on, where TBT is added to a bonding curve for a curation. End users can inherently trust the signal from a delegator because upon signaling, delegators mint a delegation share for the curation, entitling them to a portion of future curation fees that the curation drives. Delegator signal is represented as ERC20 tokens called Curation Delegator Shares (CDS). Delegators that want to earn more delegation fees should signal their TBT to curations that they predict will generate a strong flow of fees to the network. Delegators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, but there is a deposit tax on delegators to disincentivize poor decision-making that could harm the integrity of the network. Delegators also earn fewer delegation fees if they choose to delegate on a low-quality curation since there will be poor content quality, inconsistent content with curated theme, deeply nested curation, etc.\r\n\r\n\t4.4. Curator\r\n\r\n\tFor curators, we think of shops, galleries, museums, etc., which are paid for providing a channels to display and sell merchandise, paintings, artworks, etc. Curators in our economic system likewise profit by creating meaningful context for commodities (NFTs) to induce purchasing decisions.\r\nNFTs issued through our protocol will be customizable with sales splits, ie., curation fee cut, which is the portion of the rewards that the NFT owner will keep for themselves. That means if it is set to 100%, as a curator you will get 0 curation rewards. If you see 80% in the UI, that means as a curator, you will receive 20%.\r\n\r\n\t4.5. A User Case\r\n\r\n\tChloe is a travel blogger living in the UK. She usually travels all over the world, writing, taking pictures, and living the free life that people yearn for.\u00a0\r\n\tShe regularly uploads her travel articles, videos and photos to StoryLine, a hypothetical social networking application based on the TheBards Protocol. The app will mint her content into NFTs. Her fans collect her content NFTs through purchases. A travel genre curator or feed service provider will organize her content into a collection or index it in a database.\u00a0\r\n\tShe can skillfully refer to travel-related NFTs in her content with links. She can also get a certain share of the purchases fees triggered by her content, and the corresponding curators who curate her content will also have a corresponding share, all of which are stipulated in the smart contract. Delegators in the tourism field will stake their TBT to the corresponding curations, hoping to have curatorial revenue sharing in the future.\r\n\r\n\t4.6. Static and Dynamic Distribution\r\n\r\n\tAs shown in the figure below, the system includes two value distribution modes: static and dynamic distribution. Static distribution occurs on a single curation entity, whose distribution is fixed. Whereas dynamic distribution is related to the context of each transaction, i.e. curation. When the curation is different, the benefit distribution will be different. For example, 2-level nested curation and 3-level nested curation allocation scheme will be different.\r\n\r\n\t\u25cf Static Distribution: or down distribution[4], stakeholders are fixed, and the distribution ratio is also fixed.\r\n\t\u25cf Dynamic Distribution: or up distribution, stakeholders and allocation ratios depend on the context in which each transaction occurs, i.e. we have to dynamically determine which curators are there and how the value is distributed.\r\n\r\n5. Tokenomics\r\n\r\n\tThe purpose of the TheBards token (TBT) is to coordinate, bootstrap, and incentivize participants to make sure the curation economy is as effective, secure, reliable and useful as possible. In the TheBards protocol, TBT is used to buy NFTs and stake the token to mint the delegation share, the more TBT you stake, the more shares you will get for exchanging income.\u00a0\r\n\tWhen a user purchases NFTs in the context of content or curation, both creator and curator earn a partion of those curation share fees as a reward for contexts created for triggering purchase decisions.\r\n\r\n\t5.1. Rewarding Stakeholders\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to earning curation share fees, TheBards mints new token over time, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum block rewards, which are split amongst curations in proportion to their total stake relative to others in the system.\r\n\tThis has the effect of growing system ownership amongst those who participate and shrinking it amongst those who do not.\r\n\r\n\t5.2. Rounds & Inflation\r\n\r\n\tIn TheBards, new tokens are minted every so-called round. Rounds are measured in Ethereum blocks, where one round is equal to 5760 Ethereum blocks. In Ethereum, one block is mined on average every 14.89 seconds, which means one TheBards round lasts roughly 23.82 hours. Assuming the curations you're staked to is doing its job, this is how often you can expect to receive reward tokens.\r\n\tThe cool thing about TheBards is the inflation rate adjusts automatically depending on how many tokens are staked out of the total circulating supply. TheBards presupposes that a target rate of T% is a healthy trade-off between network security and token liquidity, so in order to hit this target, the protocol incentivizes stakeholders by increasing the inflation rate by a% for every round the participation rate is below T% and decreasing it a% for every round the participation rate is above T%.\r\n\r\n6.

		"description": "\r\nWe are angry about climate change. We're also pretty damn scared... the future looks utterly terrifying.\r\n\r\nAngry Teenagers is a project born out of those feelings.\r\n\r\nThey are also a reaction to the insidious idea that we need to rely on central authorities - governments and big corporations - to fix the climate catastrophe. That individuals can't make a meaningful difference.\r\n\r\nWe can, and we must. Blockchain gives us the tools we need to do that. \r\n\r\nWhen you buy an Angry Teenager NFT, your money goes to a specific, unique square of land and the NFT updates with photos as that piece of land comes back to life as a forest. You see your money making a beautiful change in the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrom degraded scrub land with few trees and little biodiversity, to a forest with trees like this: \r\n\r\n[photo: Some of the Angry Teenagers team during a site visit to a pristine forest adjacent to the first reforestation project we are undertaking. This is what we will restore the land back to. September 1st 2022] \r\n\r\nAll the funds raised from NFT sales go into a blockchain wallet that is controlled by the vote of the NFT holders. So NFT holders maintain direct control over the work they fund. \r\n\r\nAs the forests grow, they generate carbon credits. Revenue from carbon credit sales is returned to the project wallet, and the NFT holders can then vote to reinvest them in more reforestation. This creates a compounding reinvestment loop that means the impact of our NFTs grow over time. \r\n\r\nMore and more of this denuded, degraded, lifeless land is restored back into magnificently beautiful, diverse ecosystems.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first project we\u2019re funding is a youth organization in Ghana (SYND Ghana) who are training young people to rebuild an ecosystem on land that has been destroyed by intensive logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo: the Angry Teenagers and SYND Ghana team talking with the Chief of Nsonyam Ye village about the impact of the reforestation project on his community and their environment, September 1st 2022] \r\n\r\nThe first reforestation project is set up and ready to go - including detailed on the ground work with the local community to ensure maximum alignment and mutual benefit. The funds from this grant will allow us to finalise the tech platform for the sale and the voting structure of the DAO.\r\n\r\nWe also have a pipeline of further projects through which we can scale. \r\n\r\nWe are actively talking with other projects in the ReFi space about leveraging the Angry Teenagers technical and legal structure and brand in order to finance other real world projects. \r\n\r\nEverything we do is open source and designed to scale the overall impact of the ReFi space. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo: Angry Teenagers and SYND Ghana team with the young people of the community who will work on the reforestation project]\r\n\r\nAngry Teenagers are about not waiting for governments and big corporations to solve the climate catastrophe. They are about being empowered as individuals and as a community.\r\n\r\nWe can be the generation that rises to this challenge, individually and as a global community. \r\n\r\nHear more about what we're doing on the ReFi podcast: https:\/\/podcast.refidao.com\/e\/angry-teenagers-with-ben-an-eline-from-ecomint\/\r\n\r\nWe are also in the ReFi DAO Real World Assets circle. \r\n\r\nEverything we are building is open sourced: form smart contracts to the legal contracts. We have pioneered a legal structure that gives the on chain entity control over the funds, while having a real world entity that hold legal accountability. \r\n\r\nWe actively encourage other projects to use this framework to create a funding stream for their real world projects - either as an Angry Teenagers project, or under a different brand, but using the tools we've created. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our core offerings will be perpetual futures and European carbon options with elective physical settlement.\r\n\r\nNeutral's platform will allow carbon holders, brokers, and liquidity providers to hedge their holdings; offsetting entities to secure the cost of their sustainability goals \/ offsetting schedule; and carbon originators to conduct better investment analysis.\r\n\r\nProviding a derivatives platform for carbon will allow for yield and net-neutral strategies to be built on top, allowing carbon holders to earn passive yield on their holdings and offsetting users to optimize and automate their offsetting goals. Neutral will develop net-neutral strategies and support the development of yield strategies on top of our platform after successful delivery of the base derivative products.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf32 Why carbon derivatives?\r\n\r\nLooking at off-chain activity, organizations that have to follow carbon compliance schema use carbon derivatives to manage their costs and hedge their carbon positions. Organizations engaging in voluntary offsetting or have business models \/ positions with indirect exposure to carbon prices can also use derivatives to mitigate their risks. Off-chain derivatives also provide signals on future carbon prices, allowing carbon originators to conduct better investment analysis, informs organizations on the costs of their sustainability objectives, and provides policy makers with additional information to increase policy effectiveness.\r\n\r\nAs the carbon market moves on-chain, similar on-chain utility needs to be developed. At Neutral we have been working hard to develop on-chain carbon derivatives, another key piece in the ReFi ecosystem, to move us closer towards a mature, thriving on-chain carbon market.\r\n\r\n\u2699\ufe0f Product description\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to trade perpetual futures (perps) and European carbon options with optional physical delivery. We'll first introduce perps as they\u2019re a well-known, easy-to-use, hedging mechanism that doesn\u2019t fragment liquidity. Perp traders will be able to use carbon as collateral, increasing on-chain utility and allowing users to execute a long-short position in a single transaction.\r\n\r\nAs the ecosystem matures and liquidity increases, we'll start delivering more sophisticated derivative products. European carbon options will enable carbon yield vaults and improved net-neutral execution, providing offsetters with price stability and carbon holders with yield opportunities. Providing the core suite of derivative products will allow for composability and construction of complex positions with easy execution, management, and cross-margining.",

		"description": "Problem\u00a0\r\nWe build Nomis to crush two of the most significant barriers to entry- and adoption- of the whole DeFi lending which are over-collateralization and lack of reputation-based terms. Today mainstream borrowers are either not using DeFi lending due to its unattractiveness comparing to TradFi lending, or taking over-collateralized loans with unfair collateral, APR and liquidation terms.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn other words, today's DeFi loans suck:\r\n\r\n\u2022 >125% collateral scares away mainstream borrowers from DeFi loans;\r\n\u2022 Collateral liquidation terms are often tricky and make DeFi loans even more unattractive;\r\n\u2022 There are no personalized terms even if a user has 'good' or 'fair' on-chain reputation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBanks, in their turn, overcomes this problem by hiring credit scores. Such tool could also be implemented in DeFi making crypto loans more accessible for fair users and underserved populations, cultivating trust and reputation culture. Moreover, credit score negatively impact the number of crypto fraud cases by disincentivizing actors to play dirty.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nNomis is an open-source protocol which helps on-chain developers both to build better DeFi products and use cases, and to balance already existing high-TVL protocols. Every lending\/borrowing platform will be able to provide its end-users with extremely customized loan terms for borrowers by using Nomis API.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNomis is designed to be a multi\/cross-chain solution to offer the most robust financial snapshot of a potential borrower by hiring hierarchy analysis as a scoring method.\r\n\r\nNomis helps blockchains and\/or protocols to grow its TVL, MAU (as a result of acquisition of mainstream borrowers), MAD, # of on-chain use cases (as a result of opportunity provided to develop new DeFi solutions on-top of the Nomis open-source protocol).\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferentiation\r\nNomis' competitors are other credit scores such as Chainscore (NEAR), RociFi (Polygon), Spectral Finance (Ethereum), Project Galaxy, Cred Protocol, and TrueFi, etc.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNomis, in its turn, brings 2 crucial competitive advantages to the table:\u00a0\r\n1. Nomis is an open-source solution that helps web3 developers leverage credit scores building better on-chain products and communities.\r\n2. Nomis offers the most robust financial snapshot of a potential borrower by hiring multi-chain approach and hierarchy analysis as a scoring method.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's next for Nomis\r\nAs mentioned above, our goal is to allow one to borrow capital using one's on-chain reputation as a form of collateral (best case scenario), or at least provide better terms. Although, the long-term vision for Nomis goes far beyond credit scoring for DeFi: other dApps will be able to use existing Nomis Scores as well as building their own custom scores for any need (e.g. wallet qualifier for jobs applications, whitelists, special offerings for products, or just for inviting to a private party, etc.). In other words, our big-picture vision includes building the credential and identity infrastructure layer and empowering developers to build on top of it.\u00a0\r\n",

		"description": "Decentralized Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) of Regenerative Actions (like tree planting) and the Benefits of Them (Like clean air, water)\r\n\r\nWhat Is ReFi\r\nOur environment provides many benefits to humans (such as clean air, water, and productive soil), these are called Ecosystem Services. The quantity of natural assets which provide these ecosystem services (such as geology, soil, air, water, and biomass) are referred to as Natural Capital. By putting a numeric value on ecosystem services and natural capital, market-based pricing and coordination mechanisms can be used to determine the monetary value of them. Regenerative Finance (ReFi) is the process of using various forms of capital to drive systematic, sustainable, and positive change for all stakeholders. It leverages natural capital currencies and other tokenized assets for the preservation of life and ecological health. Internalizing the externalities and realizing the true value of these assets can allow us to preserve and regenerate the biosphere. Allowing us to escape a system of exploitation leading towards scarcity, and instead creating new systems that function in regeneration leading towards abundance. The most commonly known ReFi token used currently, is carbon credits.\u00a0\r\nCarbon Credits\r\nThere are main types of carbon credits: carbon avoidance, emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal. Carbon avoidance is when an organization is paid to not do an action that would produce CO2, such as cutting down a forest. This is the most common carbon credit type. This is often classified under the emission reduction credit. These credits are produced when an entity reduces the emissions they were originally producing. Carbon dioxide removal is the second type of carbon credit. Carbon removal is when an organization is paid to do an action that would remove CO2 from our atmosphere, like planting a forest. Both types of credits must have their actions go through a measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) process by a third party. When purchasing credits entities typically go through a marketplace with intermediaries connecting the producer of credits and buyers. One such intermediary is Verra, which Toucan uses to bridge their credits onto the blockchain.\r\nBroadening Scope\r\nIf carbon credits were used to offset all CO2 impacts without addressing other ecosystem services (such as biodiversity, soil quality) and social rights, we would have failed in building systems that align with the preservation and the regeneration of the biosphere. Properly designing carbon credits and other types of credits can lead to co-benefits of these other ecosystem services. MRV of these ecosystem services and social rights is difficult, as well as properly valuing them. However, organizations are already creating MRV methodologies that can be utilized (such as Regen Network, BasinDAO, and Avano).\u00a0\r\nMRV Intro\r\nMRV consists of three distinct features, all of which are vital to conveying legitimacy of regenerative projects (such as tree planting) to stakeholders. Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. When measuring data is collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys. Reporting involves describing the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, as well as potential biases and any assumptions that went into the data collection. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that was utilized to ensure the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nProblem\r\nThere are a few centralized methodologies that exist for creating credits, however few regenerative projects have the financial resources to implement or comply with them. If they do, the third parties that provide these MRV methods utilize them infrequently with little or no personal connection to the area they are monitoring. With the MRV methods currently utilized there are gaps in information, and the data backing these projects can vary significantly in precision, magnitude, and quality. Through centralization, projects are siloed and left to stand on their own. Meanwhile, overly high transaction costs to utilize existing MRV methodologies limits participation from the many decentralized projects doing regenerative action (ie. soil carbon). Without proof that they have been able to complete accreditation through the methodologies, these projects find it difficult for funders to provide them with capital. This especially impacts marginalized communities. Without coordination and cooperation with MRV, it will be difficult for regenerative projects to scale.\r\nSolution\r\nDecentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system. For current accreditation standards a combination of on the ground data collection, satellite sensing and IOT devices are used to back the credits. Utilizing web3 mentality, trust minimized data collection methods can be created. An example of this is to write open codes for actions that used to be performed by humans, like detecting a tree and the species of tree it is. Other data collection technologies can become integrated into this system as they become standard in the future.\u00a0\r\nOnce the data is collected open source reporting and verification methodologies can be utilized to analyze the data. Entities that collect the data and create the analysis methodologies are paid each time data is used and an analysis done. This inspires entrepreneurs to build specialized dMRV services which can benefit further regenerative projects. The entire dMRV allows for standardization, trustlessness, immutability, transparency, and open accessibility. This paves the way for decentralized data backed credits. These credits are tied to a specific regenerative action and entity who carried out the action continuously updated over time as more data is gathered. This data and the methodologies used to analyze it is stored permanently and immutably through technology such as IPFS, Arweave etc. The collectors of this data are the owners of it, allowing for sensitive data to be fully controlled by its owner. The dMRV would assist regenerative projects across blockchains and be interoperable with any new blockchain that came into existence. Every entity that is involved with this dMRV helps to iteratively improve upon it. With this, local communities can become more deeply involved with how the regenerative projects they carry out go through the dMRV process as well as tap into funding that was not previously available to carry out these projects. Along with that the diversity and veracity of Natural Capital assets being valued can exponentially increase.\u00a0\r\nWe are in the beginning of this dMRV process and countless building blocks are still missing. There will be problems and limitations that we encounter, but as these gradually get addressed it will become possible to use this new set of lego building blocks to build things that we can hardly imagine today.\u00a0\r\nWhat is Needed\r\nData\r\nIn this dMRV everything is open to where there is only one final layer of trust- the data itself. Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). The data collected is stored permanently and immutably through current technology such as IPFS and Arweave. By multiple data sources backing up that a regenerative action has occurred, more accurate calculations can be created. When one of those inputs is inaccurate, the other data sources can openly show a dispute. When a dispute arises, the stakeholders of the dMRV system can confirm or deny the accuracy of the data. Scoring this data for quality, resolution, and temporal frequency can enable any entity utilizing the dMRV to compare the data sources they pay for. Allowing them to quickly choose the best dataset for their needs. Through this, data becomes highly available as many organizations strive to provide the best data for people\u2019s needs. This puts publishers on a level playing field and allows the companies with the best data to naturally succeed. Along with that publishers can not only benefit from the dMRV utilizing the data but other organizations that might want their data (such as parametric insurance). When individuals can decide who gets access to their data, they can ensure it is used ethically. They can also willingly give access to their data to those attempting to create good causes.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nReporting and verification utilize algorithms. Algorithms are a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task (types of algorithms include standard, machine learning and AI). They are used to process data or information. For example georeferenced imagery can be analyzed using an algorithm that detects if a tree is present in that imagery. Another example is an algorithm can choose which data sources are the most appropriate for evaluating a regenerative action based upon how these data sources did previously. This is more efficient than a human could do, reducing the dMRV costs.\u00a0\r\nPrevious MRV organizations have developed their own algorithms. Some of these algorithms are open source and will become part of the dMRV system if there is no conflict with the creators in doing so. Oftentimes it is only the MRV organization that developed the algorithm that uses it. Allowing more entities to utilize the MRV algorithm, \u201calgorithms-as-a-service\u201d have arisen as a business model. Aaas allows entities of very small to large financial backing to benefit\u00a0from them.\u00a0For example, a small business might not have the resources to hire a data scientist to build and train a machine learning model or maintain the infrastructure needed to store the data that the model would be trained on. However, with AaaS, they can simply subscribe to a service and use the algorithms that have been created by someone else. Now through decentralization, algorithm providers can offer their services in a trust minimized and automated way. Along with that they can help financially support the providers of the data that was used to train that algorithm, which in turn gives data providers an incentive to provide high-quality and unique data that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be available for training. Algorithmic transparency allows regenerative actions to demonstrate the ecosystem services they provide in a trustless, decentralized and immutable manner. Which in turn will attract more ReFi investors to support these actions. The more funding that gets channeled towards regenerative actions, the more the dMRV system is used and with each iteration it improves.\u00a0\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\u00a0\r\nIn order to host the data and distribute money to creators of algorithms, among other components of the dMRV system, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. To permanently store the data collected, decentralized storage systems need to be utilized. For distributing that data to entities that would like to purchase it, data markets need to adequately display it. A new distributed system needs to be created for analyzing that data and paying for each time an analysis methodology is utilized. Some of these systems exist, however they can be improved upon to further support the dMRV system.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRevenue Sources\r\nThis dMRV system will be created bottom up from individuals and software, these individuals are who we aim to get rewarded through this software system. The flow of this system is planned to be as follows. An entity pays for collection of data, entities affiliated with this dMRV system collect the data using techniques that are part of this system. The data goes to decentralized storage which is paid for, then the entity that pays for the data is able to access it. The data is interpreted via methodologies either that the entity has proprietary control over or that is open source and part of the dMRV system. If the method is open source, a donation is channeled to the creators of the method for its use. The collected data is also marketed in a data marketplace, when people use the data they pay for the use of it. This payment goes towards both the marketplace and the data creator.\r\n\r\nCross Organizational Support\r\nBehind all of this are people. These people have formed their own decentralized organizations specializing in different aspects of the dMRV system. There are organizations specializing in data collection, analysis and domain experts. The organizations participating in the dMRV will continue to expand as the system builds continued support.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMap Link\r\n\r\nData Collectors\u00a0\r\nTrust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). These are the organizations that are currently the most prevalent in the web3 space doing work collecting data in each of these areas.\r\n\r\nSatellite- Shamba\r\nThe first company to launch a specialized geospatial oracle on the Chainlink network. They have extensive experience in web2 geospatial and information technology and are continuously innovating and pushing the boundaries of these spaces for web3. They have a focus on creating real world applications for this data.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDrone- VillageGrid\r\nFocused on finding web3 solutions for existing rural electrification projects, VillageGrid is using drone produced GeoTIFFs as NFTs to capture before-and-after progress updates of rural solar farms, and then exploring blockchain-based energy metering systems to improve the current billing services for said solar farms.\r\n\r\nEdge & IOT - Athena Protocol\r\nSpecializing in the deployment of edge computation networks, uncertainty accounting , and the development implementation of algorithmic fairness frameworks.\u00a0\r\nOn-boarding & human-sensing - Eco Labs \/ TIA (The Impact App)\r\nA collaborative on-boarding ecosystem for regenerative action. Eco Labs is developing TIA, an app that will function as a how-to guide for using dMRV services in ReFi, a human-sensing tool to collect images \/ video from regenerators to be used in Eco Credit methodologies for Regen Network, issue an ID associated with projects, and facilitate payments via Celo integration.\r\n\r\nHuman Sensing- ORGO\u00a0\r\nA simplified structure or system for recruiting volunteers, collecting data, managing workflows, and rewarding contributors.\r\n\r\nData Analysis\r\nOnce the data has been collected it needs to be cleaned and further analyzed. These are the organizations creating methodologies for this.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAstral\r\nPromoting the evolution of an open, human-centered and composable location-based decentralized web. They have created specialized data storage systems, data registries, and a suite of geometric and topological analysis methodologies in Solidity. \r\n\r\nAlgovera\u00a0\r\nA cooperative of people working to develop useful AI apps. Currently in the process of building systems for rewarding algorithm creators for each time their algorithm is used.\u00a0\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\nTo properly store, market and maintain the data and algorithms, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. These are the organizations currently doing work in this field.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNot Yet Participating: dClimate\u00a0\r\nA transparent, decentralized marketplace that allows participants to buy and share data and contribute to an open ecosystem of data-driven climate resilience applications.\r\n\r\nNot Yet Participating: Ocean Protocol\u00a0\r\nA data market app to publish, discover, and consume data in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.\r\n\r\nNot Yet Participating: Arweave\u00a0\r\nA decentralized data storage system for permanently storing data. Has enabled the backbone for profit sharing when algorithms are used.\r\n\r\nNot Yet Participating: IPFS\r\nA decentralized data storage system for permanently storing data. Allowing for upgrading of data without overwriting.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDomain Experts\r\nFor each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system.\u00a0\r\nAs these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEndangered Tokens Foundation\r\nEndangered species are especially fragile and need extreme support as quick as possible in order to maintain and increase their population before they go extinct. This organization is reevaluating the biodiversity that these species represent by creating web3 assets (NFTs, tokens).

		"description": "As the innovation in cryptoworld booms, Rootmeta has read the call from early explorers, builders and newcomers. The team of Rootmeta (https:\/\/app.rootmeta.xyz\/) determined to build a safe and easy trusting social ecosystem, based on the function of communication tools, integrated with decentralised technology and the spirit of Dao.\r\n\r\nThe basis for trust-building in the social network stems from breaking the barriers of information opacity.A TVI (Total Value Island) is designed for the disclosure of personal on-chain assets, which are collected and displayed on each user and communities\u2019 profile through the crypto wallet, become as proof of DID identity.This makes it easier for Individual explorer to Observe if someone is consistent with words and deeds or not and find the most reliable and valuable Influencer and info.\r\n\r\nUser experiences from two perspective show you how to link more credible crypto world in Rootmeta\r\n\r\nUsers and communities are the main roles involved in the experience and communication of the on-chain ecosystem. I will show you how to connect the on-chain communication through Rootmeta and explore the future meta-verse from these two perspectives.\r\n\r\nAs personal unser: obain a free, rich and easy social life at Rootmeta\r\n\r\n(1) Easily log in the site with any crypto wallet and to creat your own island or land on any other island which attracts you. There is also no need to worry about harassing messages sent from unconsious-click pages. You\u2019ll get a clean and pure social space and can concentrate on your interests or interacting with friends.\r\n\r\n(2) Freely and smoothly swich to other applications in the crypto world through Rootmeta, while chatting with friends and community. No cumbersome clicking to switch pages. No risk of phishing sites.\r\n\r\nFor community leader: Harnessing the power of community building and sharing\r\n\r\nIf someone who wishes to extend their influence, they need to fully demonstrate the authenticity of their experience, by showing asset lists or other on-chain badges and markers to prove the authenticity of their experience.\r\n\r\nFor the founder and leader of the community, Rootmeta offers a variety of tools in the community management to meet the needs of the communicate and carrying out various group tasks in the virtual space. And also designed leaderboard to help them to attract like-minded follower and builders into community, maximisethe enthusiasm of community- building, increase the influence of the community.\r\n\r\nAnd community benefits distributed back to members is also encouraged in the Rootmeta. Rootmeta has set up a NFT as community incentives to encourage the community to create together and improve the TVI ranking. Top 500 of the leaderboard will be rewarded with NFT and other benefits in the future.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nRootmeta is still a rare and bold attempt in the social market today, which integrates the function of traditional social tools with the features of crypto production, still at the beginning of journey to building. But at least it has already shown a true user-friendly intention and determination to clean up the online-social environment. Such a multi-functional social product needs more and more voices from user to help them optimise from the feedback. The future development of product and team is worth looking forward to. Let\u2019s wait and see what will happen.",

If the stablecoin basket was backed by 25% USDC, and the social consensus shifted towards being wary of USDC because of potential blacklisting, informed token holders could vote to rebalance and have the token be backed by only 10%, or 0% USDC. \r\nBecause the voting token is the token backed by the assets, holders are incentivized to vote for the best assets, so they don't lose money, and so this becomes a reasonable measure of social consensus of which stablecoins to trust with your money, for people who are less informed.\r\nThis could also be used for social consensus of staked ETH tokens, or a sort of on-chain \"ETF\" of a bunch of different tokens, or anything you can come up with!\r\nIt may be possible to have different tokenomics and governance if people really really want it, but this is the basic idea, and this description will likely be improved in the near future.

		"description": "We\u2019re building a cornerstone for decentralized academia by creating a learning app that rewards its participants with tokens and NFT certificates.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nWhat is Hedgefox?\r\nHedgefox is primarily a web-based, mobile-friendly learning platform and eventual DAO that rewards its learners and teachers for participating in the app through issuing crypto tokens and NFT certificates. We hope to help individuals and institutions rethink what higher education could look like - not as a centralized, expensive, and cumbersome machine, but potentially as an open, interactive, and affordable ecosystem of ideas, communities, and investment.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the value proposition?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat if we could pay students to learn?\r\nHedgefox started with a very simple question - what if you could pay people to learn? What would that do for the well-being of millions of people across the globe? What if we could provide people with more incentive to better themselves without sacrificing their financial stability? The result would be a positive-sum game wherein students, teachers, employers, institutions, and investors are all able to benefit from a learning ecosystem that is both sustainable and profitable.\r\nThanks to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, we are able to build systems that make this possible. As we have seen in new innovations such as DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, blockchain tech opens up a new paradigm that allows the users to control and benefit from complex systems rather than a select few. In the same way that blockchain has decentralized finance, art, companies, and entertainment, so it can decentralize education without negatively impacting the existing institutions and ecosystem.\r\n\r\nProject Goals\r\nThe Hedgefox purpose is to build a sustainable and profitable informal social learning platform that results in both a financially positive-sum game for all stakeholders\u00a0and\u00a0competent and compassionate problem solvers. While there are a myriad of goals that could be pursued by the Hedgefox project, there are 4 primary problems we\u2019ve framed as goals that we feel are both attainable and within the scope of blockchain technology.\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\nReduce student debt across a variety of sectors.\u00a0This includes higher education, professional education, and social education.\r\n\r\nEnact universal, verifiable credentials that are stored on-chain.\u00a0These take the form of personalized NFTs that can be used for professional or educational purposes.\r\n\r\nReduce knowledge silos.\u00a0Knowledge is often hidden and contained within select institutions, but open education is helping to change this.\r\n\r\nCreate a framework for creating high-quality, peer-reviewed content.\u00a0Starting with informal and social learning, Hedgefox hopes to be a hub for institutions, learners, faculty, employers, and investors to create incredible content through community consensus.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nThe proliferation of Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, and other short-form content has exacerbated the attention deficit we experience in our lives. As a result, the way we learn as humans is fundamentally changing as well. People find it more difficult to not only find time to learn, but they also demand the flexibility to do it anywhere and at their own pace.\r\nMany people unknowingly have created their own personal learning networks (PLNs) through community tools such as Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, and niche email newsletters. These micro-learning environments are difficult to quantify and even more difficult to reproduce effectively in traditional education.\r\n\r\nTaking Cues\r\nHedgefox seeks to take cues from these trends and build a learning platform that hinges on threaded short-form content. Such content should be both easily consumable and incredibly rewarding for the learner. By combining communal, short-form content types, we hope to intentionally create an\u00a0informal\u00a0learning platform that is impactful and high-quality - something that is highly elusive within traditional pedagogy.\r\nWe believe the best learning occurs when learners are self-directed, in community with others, and have the opportunity to engage with high-quality content tailored to their interests.\r\n\r\nCool, but what does that look like?\r\nIf you've ever used Twitter, you know that many people are obsessed with making threads of tweets for people to read. There is even a Twitter thread unroller app that you can use to read threaded tweets more like a book. What we discovered is that there is an immense amount of knowledge buried in short-form content like this on sites like Twitter, Reddit, Quora, and even TikTok. By providing a similar, yet expanded experience to learners, we hope to incentivize learners to create and learn from a community of people while being rewarded to do so.\r\nThe platform will utilize a hierarchical system comprised of Creds (as opposed to threads \ud83d\ude06), Pages, and Blocks. Each Cred will be centered around a topic or competency for learners to engage with. Within each Cred are various Pages or sub-topics. Within each Page, is a list of content Blocks such as text, links, videos, audio clips, and questions. By structuring content in this way, learners are able to clearly see what they are learning and how the concepts interplay.\r\nAdditionally, each Page will eventually have a discussion area where users can comment and discuss about the content. Providing a space for interaction allows learners to hear different perspectives and perhaps make lasting professional connections with others.\r\n\r\nMobile-First\r\nCreating a platform with priorities on mobile responsiveness and accessibility is paramount for Hedgefox. Focusing on developing a mobile-first platform has several important motivators:\r\n\r\nThe majority of the world has a cell phone, but far fewer people have access to internet and a desktop or laptop computer. Being mobile-first allows us to reach those who will value access to education the most.\r\nThe majority of all social experiences take place on mobile. Hedgefox seeks first to become a social learning platform for adoption purposes so mobile-first makes sense.\r\nMobile learning is increasingly a more common way to consume content and interact with educational content. Learners demand the flexibility and agency that mobile-first platforms offer.\r\n\r\nThe HFOX Token\r\nTechnicals\r\nThe native utility, incentivization, and governance token for Hedgefox is HFOX - an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainnet. While operating smart-contracts on Ethereum mainnet is not ideal in terms of speed or transaction cost, it does provide our users with the best experience for cashing out their earnings and transferring them among wallets and exchanges. It also ensures future interoperability with other blockchains through Ethereum bridges, oracles, and other blockchain solutions. Should the future DAO vote to create a standalone blockchain network, ERC20 standards make this migration much easier. Additionally, building on Ethereum mainnet also ensures compatibility with a variety of industry standard wallets and dApps. With the introduction of the Ethereum Consensus Layer, adoption of Ethereum is likely to become highly mainstream, ensuring a robust ecosystem for HFOX holders to participate in for years to come.\r\n\r\nBurning and Minting\r\nThe foundation for Hedgefox's unique tokenomics is a delicate balance of the minting and burning of tokens. This mechanism aims to keep the supply of learners balanced with the token supply, always ensuring the protocol is able to pay its participants without creating rampant inflation or diluting current holders.\r\nBy burning and minting tokens based on completion rates, it is possible to create a sustainable payout system that leverages supply\/demand and user incentive to maintain a balance between token supply, token price, and user supply. The burn rate and mint rate are levers that the protocol and eventual DAO has at its disposal to maintain stability and sustainability. These rates are based on the total reserve amount left so that theoretically, the Reserves are never depleted.\r\n\r\nInitial Burn Rate per block per Start:\u00a0%0.00001 of Reserves\r\nInitial Reward Rate per block per Completion:\u00a0**%**0.00001 of Reserves\r\nInitial Mint Rate per block per Completion:\u00a0%0.000025 of Reserves\r\n\r\nThe mint rate will always need to be at least double the burn and reward rates in order to replace tokens that are burned\/rewarded, but this can also be decided on by the DAO in the future. The protocol only mints tokens when there are more cred completions than cred starts.\r\n\r\nUser Flow and Process\r\nWhen a user begins a cred on the platform (either learning, teaching, or peer-reviewing), it is marked in their user record that a certain amount of tokens should be burned from the Hedgefox Reserves - the actual burn takes place later. This decreases the remaining supply and slightly increases the value of the remaining tokens. The more people who begin creds, the more tokens will be burned. As the price per token increases so does the incentive to complete the cred, because...\r\nOnce a user completes a cred, it is marked in their user record that tokens should be minted to the Hedgefox Reserves and the majority of those tokens be rewarded to the user - the actual payout and mint takes place later. As more users complete courses, the supply of the token increases which decreases the price of the remaining tokens (inflation). Thus, if cred completion rates remain high for extended periods of time, HFOX token will become inflationary. If completion remains low, the HFOX token becomes deflationary as people start or abandon creds without completing them.\r\n\r\nInitial Distribution\r\nThe initial and maximum supply of the HFOX token is 1.65 billion. And is distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Fungible Token Certificates\r\n\r\nNon-fungible tokens serve as a valuable technology in the Hedgefox ecosystem. When a user completes a credential in any way as a learner, faculty, or peer-reviewer, an NFT is minted on the Hedgefox credential NFT contract and sent to their wallet. The minted NFT contains attributes about the credential, the Hedgefox user who completed it, when it was completed, and other important information. The new NFT serves as an immutable badge that the Hedgefox user can show to potential employers, colleagues, or other learners. Because of blockchain technology, even if the credential NFT is sold, lost, or burned, it will always be able to be verified that the user completed the credential. Moreover, NFTs are easily shareable, easily displayed, and easily verified through platforms such as OpenSea, TofuNFT, Zapper, or other wallets. Users will be able to see and share Hedgefox credentials in the Hedgefox app as well. NFT's also open the door to solving a major issue in academia by providing verifiable, universal credentialing that can be published, transferred, and verified by any institution or organization. This eliminates major complications for several stakeholders:\r\nIt becomes easier for learners to transfer credits across institutions.\r\nIt becomes easier for employers to verify an applicants transcripts.\r\nIt becomes easier for institutions to publish and track learner and faculty achievements.\r\nIt allows Hedgefox to formally recognize strategic partners and generous donors through limited edition tokens.",

		"description": "Goal: The goal of the Good Science Project is better science funding in the United States that leads to faster scientific innovation than the status quo.\u00a0 That is, science funding should:\u00a0\r\nBe more streamlined with fewer administrative burdens;\u00a0\r\nHave less focus on incremental advances based on preliminary results, and more willingness to consider high-risk projects, open-ended exploration of basic science, etc.;\u00a0\r\nOffer more funding for a person\/team over longer time frames, rather than narrowly specified projects over short time frames; and,\u00a0\r\nBe more open to areas outside of the current status quo.\u00a0\r\nThese ideas can be reduced to specific policy proposals depending on what is politically feasible.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStrategy and Activities: Our theory of change is that compelling public communication over the long term can be very influential to steer public discourse and policy conversations. Our communications will take numerous forms \u2013 white papers, essays and blog posts, op-eds, social media, and interviews with practicing scientists. As well, we're co-sponsoring a conference this fall with Brookings and the Institute for Progress on a problem that Stuart identified (the NIH hasn't been using an advisory board that Congress mandated as a way to achieve reform). As Jack Clark from Anthropic says, \u201cPeople wildly underestimate how much influence individuals can have in policy. I've had a decent amount of impact by just turning up and working on the same core issues (measurement and monitoring) for multiple years.\u201d\r\n\r\nA secondary work product is interaction with policymakers, whether at agencies, Congress, or the White House. Our key advisers include former White House and NSF personnel, and a number of policymakers (from ARPA-H to congressional staff) have asked us for advice and ideas. \r\n\r\nPersonnel: The Good Science Project is led by Stuart Buck. He spent 9 years as the VP of Research at Arnold Ventures, where he led internationally-renowned work on scientific reproducibility, including strategizing the launch of the Center for Open Science, the TOP Guidelines, Vivli, and more. He was an expert adviser to the GAO on its recent report on improving federally-funded research. He has lectured at DARPA and IARPA, and has authored pieces in Science and Nature, on how to improve research.\r\n\r\nEric Gilliam is a Fellow of the Good Science Project, and has done extensive work analyzing science policy. In the near future, we hope to hire a Senior Fellow who can focus on improving how clinical trials are funded and operated.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, we hope to hire:\r\nTwo or three people with experience in science policy and communications, and the gravitas to meet with policymakers.\u00a0\r\nAn administrative person who can do everything from editing articles to planning convenings, and\r\nA grant manager to make external grants to like-minded academics and organizations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBoard: Members include Daniel Goroff (Sloan Foundation; formerly Harvard, Harvey Mudd, NSF and White House), Brian Nosek (University of Virginia and Center for Open Science), Chonnettia Jones (President of Addgene), and Michael Stebbins (President of Science Advisers, and formerly at the White House).\u00a0\r\n\r\nExternal advisors include Prachee Avasthi (Dartmouth; Arcadia Science); Phil Bourne (formerly NIH Assistant Director of Data Science; University of Virginia); Dan Correa (President, Federation of American Scientists); Tyler Cowen (George Mason): Maryrose Franko (Health Research Alliance): Kumar Garg (Schmidt Future; former White House OSTP); Joe Ross (Yale); and Heidi Williams (Stanford).\u00a0\r\n\r\nOperations: The Good Science Project will operate virtually for now. Initial funding is from Patrick Collison, ACX, and the Survival and Flourishing Fund. If future funding is secured on a longer-term basis, we may consider opening a physical office. We are fiscally sponsored by the New Venture Fund so as to become operational more quickly and efficiently.",

		"description": "Scholar is bringing research publication on-chain.\r\n\r\nWe're developing a platform for researchers to publish and fund their research, to democratize access to the powerful crypto and DeSci primitives through great and simple UX.\r\n\r\nYou have probably seen our prototype that Balaji Srinivasan shared on Twitter. We're essentially building out the vision that him and many others have laid out, where:\r\n\u2013 Anyone can access science\r\n\u2013 Anyone can independently verify research\r\n\u2013 Anyone can contribute to the public good of science\r\n\u2013 Nobody can censor it\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n\r\nLike most institutions, our systems for science have become ossified and are no longer aligned on progress. Many have been talking about these problems for years, but to give a quick overview:\r\n\r\nYou've probably experienced opening up a research paper and getting hit with a paywall. That's because a few for-profit companies monopolize publication and prestige, and since prestige is the currency of academia, researchers are stuck in a zero-sum competition to publish or perish.\r\n\r\nThe recent case where 16 years of Alzheimer's research was based on falsified data is largely due to these competitive dynamics. Experiment results are faked, ideas are stolen, and researchers aren't open to discussing results in the open, just because they're fighting to survive within this sclerotic system.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nThere are many working on trying to fix the old system, but rather than reform, we're building anew. Researchers are already decentralizing away from academia into DAOs like VitaDAO and PsyDAO, as well as new institutes like New Science and Arcadia Science.\r\n\r\nScholar's goal is to create a publication platform for these researchers.\r\n\r\nA platform where they can:\r\n\u2013 Publish on-chain\r\n\u2013 Have immutable backups of their research\r\n\u2013 Enable anyone to reproduce their results by linking all research artifacts\r\n\u2013 Evolve beyond the archaic PDF format\r\n\r\nSociety as a whole would then be able to:\r\n\u2013 Verify research, rather than just \"trusting science\"\r\n\u2013 Have open access to the public good of science\r\n\u2013 Build on top of this open knowledge graph\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n\r\nWe're still in the early stages, but this grant money would go towards building out this vision. Here's the rough idea (this is subject to change):\r\n\r\n1. Build out the platform and smart contracts\r\nWe may use the smart contract infrastructure that DeSci Labs is building out if it suits our needs and is flexible enough.\r\n\r\n2. Post notable research papers on-chain into a citation graph\r\nTo show that we can have composable science, just like composable finance, and to tangibly show researchers the benefits of publishing on Scholar.\r\n\r\n3. Build the interface needed for researchers to be able to use crypto-native research tools\r\nThis includes publishing, but may include funding, ideating, collaborating, etc. as well.\r\n\r\n4. Simultaneously backfill historical papers\r\nSo we can get an open graph of all of humanity's knowledge.",

		"description": "Mojo is an audio\/media streaming platform that empowers musicians, artists and content creators through web3 and blockchain technologies using IPFS.\r\n\r\nThe Mojo web3 application allows users to upload their valuable digital assets easily and seamlessly to the IPFS Network via our user interface. Files can never get deleted, hacked, edited, stolen and are never saved to a server making them truly decentralised.\r\n\r\nIPFS is a wonderful technology as it allows for content ownership, portability, and verifiability. It powers NFT marketplaces, individual websites, file-sharing platforms, and so much more. However, IPFS, the protocol, does not have a responsibility to match the experience of traditional cloud file services. Instead, that responsibility falls onto the shoulders of the IPFS adopters.\r\n\r\nMojo helps fill this gap and gives musicians, artists and all content creators an opportunity to broaden their social reach by offering specially crafted audio and media NFTs that allow their followers and subscribers to access special content or unique features they provide. This can include additional videos or written content for example.\r\n\r\nCreators can Mint NFTs and then add different attributes and values and assign these to the NFT based on the media type. Creators will be able to manage their NFT's metadata using Tableland's relational metadata protocol for EVM chains. This freedom allows creators to update non-essential data, yet keeping the true values of the NFT's in tack and aligned with core NFT standards. \r\n\r\nTableland also opens up doors to cross-chain relational data for NFTs and so much more, different content could be linked from the various networks offering users even more value for their hard earned crypto.\r\n\r\nMusic platforms and streaming is not new technology. However, IPFS is still new enough that streaming is not yet native to its content delivery. And that\u2019s exactly why Pinata is releasing streaming video through their Dedicated Gateways. \r\n\r\nWith streaming video in place, those who visit your gateway will no longer have to wait for a video file to download fully before it can be played. Just visit the URL and the video will start streaming, just like you would expect with Netflix or Youtube, just much better. Using this NFT based content, artists can already start offering content to holders using Pinata's Submarine which will be another great feature to integrate.\r\n\r\nMojo aims to further it's product by building the following key features in the Mojo web3 application:\r\n\r\nArtists should be able to upload their content in a secure and friendly manner.\r\nListeners\/viewers should be able to view music streams on the platform free of charge\r\nThe Mojo platform should offer cryptocurrency-based payments to artists and their audiences.\r\nMusic fans should have full access to their favourite artists with bonus content and features.\r\nUpon the purchase of a NFT, smart contracts should automatically process payments of royalty fees to digital artists and content creators.\r\nThe platform should use blockchain to keep transactions and accounting transparent.\r\nThe platform should let the artists keep most of the revenue they generate with very small fees to maintain the Mojo geek-o-system.\r\nListeners\/viewers shouldn\u2019t have to contend with tacky ads. The platform should consider other monetisation options, For e.g., artists can set up an agreement with their fans to share revenue if fans share music, helping it to reach a wider audience. NFT based content, artist can offer content to holders using the new Pinata Submarine feature. Establish a very high standard of niche advertising to followers\r\nA simple user interface (UI) is important.\r\nA Defi element should be added to our token contracts to allow staking of NFTs\r\n\r\nA buidl by Craig Moss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Swapp.gg resolves all these issues. With Swapp.gg crypto traders may cross-exchange more than 200 cryptocurrencies in minutes, with no KYC or registration required. Suppose you have BTC and want Solana. Instead of registering to Binance, completing KYC, and waiting for approval, you can simply visit swapp, send BTC, and instantly receive SOL in your wallet. Your keys = Your Crypto. The same is true for over 200 cryptocurrencies, including USDT on various chains. Swapp.gg generates revenue of 1.5% each transaction. Swapp.gg serves as an exchange, as a bridge, and as a mixer. A native app for iOS and Android is being developed, and a buy\/sell with credit card capability is in discussion.\u00a0\n\nNow why is this an excellent opportunity:\u00a0\n\n- 1.5% of all transactions' is revenue for the Swapp. An annual transaction volume of $100 million would generate $1.5 million in income.\u00a0\n- The Swapp is not liable for a breach, but rather the entity supplying liquidity to the exchange will be affected. We do not store and supply crypto for the exchange to function because it runs through the API a funded wallet. Incase of a breach, the API is switched to another provider. \n- Opportunity of a DAO Token for investors to produce passive income for themselves, and to serve as governance over what tokens to add or remove. \nPassive income. Token shares the same mechanism and fundamentals of a regular stock. 1% of all transaction volume is distributed to Token holders on the first of every month. Team will not hold any prior tokens. Team has the approval to purchase tokens. Team's share is 0.5% of transaction volume, by standard. 65% of funds raised will be used towards liquidity. 35% will be reserved for the team, developers, and marketing.\n\n\n",

		"description": "INFINITRI is a web3 organization based in Paramaribo, Suriname, that aims to redefine forest preservation and regeneration through the use of technology, financial tools and real world development. At the center of these developments are the communities that have lived in these forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Patamacca\r\nPatamacca is a resort in Suriname located in the District of Marowijne, with a total area of 1,183 km2. The resort of Patamacca has historically been inhabited by maroon tribes. According to the last census held in 2020, the area was inhabited by roughly 470 people.\r\n\r\nThis resort's main economic activity came from its local palm oil industry. This industry was destroyed due to the consequences of the Surinamese civil war in the 1980\u2019s. During the 1960\u2019s there was also an attempt at a large forest plantation by Bruynzeel, but that project was abandoned eventually.\r\n\r\nBesides a large granite mine operated by Grassalco, there are little to no legal and sustainable developments in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe China Zhong Hen Tai Company\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to redevelop the resort of Patamacca and its palm oil industry, the government of Suriname signed a deal with the China Zhong Hen Tai (CZHT) company in 2004. In exchange for the development of a palm oil plantation and community investments for the inhabitants of the resort, CZHT was awarded a 520km2 concession and granted an ICL (incidental cutting license). This license gives the holder the ability to cut down all trees in that area, in this case for the development of the palm oil plantation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs things stand there is no palm oil plantation and no job opportunities for the tribes of Patamacca. There is a growing group that now resorts to illegal logging and gold mining. The current sitting government of Suriname has announced it has started the process of withdrawing the license given to CZHT.\r\n\r\nInformation gathered on the company and past government dealings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResort Patamacca and the CZHT concession (ICL License 32g). gonini.org\r\n\r\nHow we intend to solve the problem\r\n\r\nWe are using blockchain technology as a foundation for the products and services we intend to offer. We believe that this technology will assist in bridging the gap between preservation efforts and sustainable economic growth.\r\n\r\nFarming as a Service\r\n\r\nWe see Farming as a Service as a great opportunity to bring investment opportunities and create jobs for the people of Patamacca. Through land fractionalization on-chain we could offer plots of land on which the various tribes of Patamacca will use for farming.\r\n\r\nWe aim to partner with several local and international farm companies, that will not only assist in the development of this project but also teach the necessary techniques that are required for in-forest farming. With the assistance of these partners, we can work towards farm products that can be exported throughout the region.\r\n\r\nThrough a user-friendly dashboard, royalties earned and other important information about the plot of land will be displayed.\r\n\r\nPlots of land would be offered as the project and the demand for the product grows. Our goal is to gradually develop between 5 to 10km2 for the usage of the Farming as a Service model.\r\n\r\nAll funds received through GR15 will be allocated towards building our Farming as a Service model and invest in the necessary infrastructure to further help reach our goal. \r\n\r\nForests preservation\r\n\r\nThe remaining land will be preserved and only used for development that directly benefits the tribes of Patamacca. If and when this project is eligible for carbon credits, we will use these funds to help further develop the amenities needed for those living\u00a0 in Patamacca.\r\n\r\nMeet our team\r\nTim\t\t\t\t\t\r\nTwitter\r\nLinkedIn\r\n\r\nSedale\r\nTwitter\r\nLinkedIn\r\n\r\nMitch\r\nTwitter\r\nLinkedIn\r\n\r\nGiani\r\nLinkedIn\r\n\r\nCurrent Status\r\n\r\nWe are engaged in talks with the Surinamese government in order to present INFINITRI and in general ReFi as a credible and earth-loving option for the development of Patamacca.\r\n\r\nWe would love to receive your help and funding in order for us to further develop and reach our goal of creating green opportunities for the tribes of Patamacca. We are thankful for this opportunity and are looking forward to keeping on building.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out to us via our Website  or Twitter\r\n\r\nLobi,\r\nTeam INFINITRI\r\n",

Founder Divya Jyoti Sen and co-founder Jade Lai-ting li started a team of 22 web experts with over 12 years of experience that can provide the best website design, development, and marketing services to grow their client\u2019s business online. Recently we have launched a new platform called Newsmartjob to provide opportunities and freelancing gigs to job seekers in the blockchain industry. Ours is the only blockchain smart contract freelance platform to ever exist. \r\n\r\nSmart contracts are digital contracts that work on certain terms and conditions to make sure whether an agreement is automatically executed or not. Official contracts like these are necessary to satisfy the freelancers and the clients that their payment and task will be completed satisfactorily.As a freelancer, it\u2019s very important to have trust and transparency with your clients. Because that is the foundation of any successful business. There are numerous platforms out there that help freelancers get good gigs and consistent work. But when it comes to payment, their process is either too slow or clients back out at the last moment.Whatever the reason, freelancers have to suffer in the end. They are overworked and denied their reward, whether intentionally or unintentionally. But this doesn\u2019t happen with Newsmartjob because we use smart contracts like MetaMask to avoid any kind of payment delay. Interestingly, we are the only ones to have this system as of now. MetaMask is a kind of smart contract or a cryptocurrency wallet that single\u0002handedly works on both desktop and mobile devices. It is popular because of its ability to buy, send and receive cryptocurrency from within the wallet. Smart contracts provide this level of security and safety among job seekers to maintain their trust. With the presence of these digital contracts, it becomes easier for freelancers to provide great value to their clients without any second thoughts. Newsmartjob accepts everyone around the globe to be a part of their platform and earn a consistent income through it. With emerging advanced technologies like these, people can trust freelancing as a legit carrier choice. \r\n\r\nJust like other jobs, freelancing has its pros and cons but one of its biggest drawbacks was denied payment. Nobody likes losing their hard-earned money. Newsmartjobs understands this pain and agony and their smart contracts act as a painkiller for the same.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us for more details.\r\n\r\nSite : https:\/\/newsmartjob.com\r\nGithub : https:\/\/github.com\/devnsw\r\nInstagram : https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/newsmartjob\/, https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yuko.tomika\/\r\nLinkedin\u00a0: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/newsmartjob\r\nTwitter\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0: https:\/\/twitter.com\/newsmartjob\r\nTelegram\u00a0: https:\/\/t.me\/looking4jobs\r\nWhatsapp\u00a0: https:\/\/wa.me\/919465957001\r\n\r\nSignup : https:\/\/newsmartjob.com?hash=37005210e23681aed354d34d981c172a\r\n",

CrypTix will be an all-in-one ticketing platform for consumers and event organizers alike. \r\n\r\nConsumers will be able to buy and sell tickets to their favorite concerts, sporting events, etc. with either cash or their favorite crypto's (currently Eth and ERC-20 tokens). They will receive their tickets in the form of NFT's. Blockchain tech brings with it the piece of mind that the users tickets are valid, legitimate tickets that can be traced from their initial listing on the CrypTix platform by the event organizers themselves. This aspect is not only appealing to consumers, but also to the event organizers themselves. They can see just how their tickets move throughout the platform. This gives them a clearer depiction of primary sales and in turn secondary resales. It allows transparency for all parties involved. \r\n\r\nThe CrypTix ticketing platform will be built on the Ethereum network and governed by the CrypTix smart contract. All transactions on the platform will involve the native CrypTix token. The token will be a deflationary asset with tokenomics. \r\n\r\nThe tokenomics of the CrypTix token are as follows:\r\n\r\nFor market transactions, a 10% fee\r\n4% redistributed to all holders of the CrypTix token proportional to the amount of the token that they hold\r\n2% sent to the burn address\r\n2% sent to the CrypTix token Liquidity Pool\r\n2% sent to the CrypTix research and development wallet\r\nFor peer-2-peer transactions, a 5% fee\r\n2% redistributed to all holders of the CrypTix token proportional to the amount of the token that they hold\r\n1% sent to the burn address\r\n1% sent to the CrypTix token Liquidity Pool\r\n1% sent to the CrypTix research and development wallet\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap of CrypTix\r\nMarketing Campaign\r\nToken ICO\r\nMarketplace Web App\r\nMarketplace Mobile App\r\nNFT Marketplace\r\nNFTs pegged to tickets and transferable across the Ethereum network\r\n\r\nSee an in depth breakdown of the plans and aspirations of CrypTix on our whitepaper shown at www.cryptixevents.com\r\n\r\n",

We are also rapidly expanding our offering of this liquidation health dashboard to other protocols while also expanding our product suite.\r\n\r\nProtecting Fish from Contagion\r\nDuring the crypto collapse of May 2022, many whales had over-borrowed betting on asset prices and yields that proved to be unsustainable. As liquidators sold massive amounts of collateral on exchanges, collateral prices dropped, which resulted in more liquidations.\r\nWe created Defishy to democratize liquidation health data of all wallets, such that users are able to manage liquidation risk more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe Future of Defishy (and why we need your support!)\r\nBecause of the great initial reception for our liquidation health dashboard, we are now developing our product offering to a full DeFi analytics suite. Below are two Figma mockups of what Defishy will look like in the future:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs shown in this bottom mockup, we are also currently focusing on sourcing historical data for more historical trend analysis as well as simulation modeling.

Moreover, their packaging plays an important role in increasing sales because humans respond to good visuals. In other words, your boxes can be as stylish as your products are.\r\n\r\nYou can design a custom product box by using various tools and services that are available online. You can use their design tool to see how your design will look before it's printed. There are many styles available, including the Straight Tuck End style.

But a developer has no control whatsoever over how their open-source code is subsequently used.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the accusations against Alex threaten to kill the entire open-source software segment. No one will dare to write and publish open-source code, no one will invest in the segment if they could be made responsible for the use of the tool they created by other parties.\r\n\r\nTo stand for developers\u2019 right to create open-source software, you need to act NOW!\r\n\r\nHelp to free innocent person and make your impact in the future of open-source development!\r\n\r\nIf you can, attend a protest rally in Amsterdam on Saturday, August 20, at 16:00 on Dam Square.\r\n\r\n#OpenSourceNotACrime #PrivacyNotACrime #freepertsev \r\n#FreeAlekseyPertsev #FreeAlex\r\n\r\nMore info on the rally: https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/cryptocanal\/events\/287867009\r\nTelegram group: https:\/\/t.me\/+0tKJW0Xoolo3M2Ri",

		"description": "IOUplay aims to increase trust between gamers, guilds, and GameFi NFT investors. Basing on IOUtokens, \"people's money with feedback\" - SBT (soulbounded tokens). It means\u00a0 tokenized civil debts receipts, promissory notes, or convertible notes, issued by anyone, anytime, anywhere, & backed by goods & services. The community rates & acts as sureties for responsible issuers so they can qualify for financing.\r\nThe investor who bought game NFTs wants to get revenue from its renting. But they don't know who comes to rent this NFT because they see just a game account. We trying to\u00a0 solve this\u00a0 problem.\r\nWe offer investors a new instrument of gamer's reputation - the IOU token. At this token saved history of rents, wons (and fails) of this gamer.\r\nAfter every renting period, investors can burn one gamer IOU and rate their results.\r\nEverybody can see this rating and feedback.\r\nWhile communicating with the players, we found out that the game guilds need \u201creplenishment\u201d in the form of active and trained players, while new players, \u201cnewbies,\u201d face complex rules, and it is difficult for them to understand the winning strategies immediately.\r\n\r\nWe used the soul bounded token (IOUtoken) developed by us, with which the student can pay the teacher. Thus, the teacher becomes interested in teaching students. A teacher later receives students' gaming obligations either as the time of their playing or just sell them.\r\nSince the Master spends his time fiddling with the beginner, and the beginner saves time on figuring it all out, he pays the master time with his IOUtoken obligation, and the master writes the beginner's \u201cqualification\u201d there as a recommendation.\r\n\r\nWe are creating a school of reputation capital to teach players how to use SB tokens. We are running a peer-to-peer program to train \u201cnewcomers\u201d by already experienced players (\u201cmasters\u201d) to earn money in new games and increase their attractiveness as players for investors in P2E.\r\nExperienced players can earn extra money by teaching beginners. And beginners quickly master the intricacies of the game. For example:\r\n1. The master recommends NFTs that make sense to buy and rent;\r\n2. The master gives a list of winning combinations and strategies in the game;\r\n3. The master explains the basic principles of the game through NFT combinations (or intelligent action algorithms);\r\n4. You can zoom master and novice and share the game screen to make moves with recommendations;\r\n5. A beginner can send logs of his \u201cfights\u201d to the master and receive comments about what was done wrong;\r\n6. Under the guidance of the master, you can set up some automated options (if there are bots in the game, for example, auto-renewal of the lease, search for a profitable lease, etc.);\r\n7. The master can help them understand the interfaces and features.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, based on the player\u2019s interest, we are making an exchange (a fork of Uniswap) so that these tokens can be staked and investors, seeing the ratings and achievements of the players, can invest in players, as in a \u201ctraditional\u201d sport.\r\n\r\nWe are making an Escrow - a smart contract \u201cfor learning\u201d - a student and a teacher exchange obligations for learning and paying by moving them to this smart contract. Tokens move irrevocably. After a period agreed by the parties, each participant gets access to the tokens of the other.\r\n\r\nAlso, gamers can transfer their SBT IOUtokens to each other tokens contract\u00a0 to make mutual surety.\r\n\r\nProject currently deployed\u00a0 on \u00a0Moonriver, Polygon, Harmony, Aurora,\u00a0 Celo and several testchains. In close future - on Heco, BNB\u00a0 and Fantom.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "What causes endometriosis? We don\u2019t know.\r\nWhy do women go through menopause? We don\u2019t know.\r\nWhy are women 2x more at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease? We don\u2019t know.\r\nWhat is the long-term impact of hormonal contraceptives? We don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\n\u2019We don\u2019t know\u2019 isn\u2019t good enough.\r\n\r\nWhat is Repro Grants?\u00a0\r\n\r\nRepro Grants is a \u201cfast grants\u201d program that awards $10K-$100K to ambitious research projects aiming to deepen our understanding of the female reproductive system. We are motivated to learn how our bodies work, so we can develop better diagnostics and interventions to improve women's health outcomes and longevity.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFindings enabled by this program will allow all other researchers and entrepreneurs to build on top of the knowledge and further expedite the overlooked field. To enable open science, we first need science. Hence, unlocking funding for basic research is a crucial first step toward a thriving open science ecosystem that supports women\u2019s reproductive health solutions. All manuscripts reporting work supported by the grant will be uploaded to a preprint server such as bioRxiv or arXiv or even Desci nodes upon submission. We don\u2019t want to delay the impact of the work by long publication cycles!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to get funding for novel and experimental research. We're making the application and review process efficient (the application form takes ~30 minutes to complete and the applicant will get a decision within 21 days) so scientists can focus on what matters the most \u2013- doing the science.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re embarrassingly late.\r\n\r\nSince the Hippocratic oath, the male body has been the \u201cmedical norm\u201d. Only in 1993 did the NIH, the primary federal agency for supporting medical science, first mandate that clinical trials should be run on both men and women. Unfortunately, this law only applied to NIH grantees and not the pharma industry which is responsible for more than 90% of trials. This means that modern medicine is based on research almost exclusively done on male bodies, with severe implications on women\u2019s health outcomes:\u00a0\r\n\u21e8 We overmedicate women. Most drugs have a 'one-size-fits-all' dosage despite obvious sex differences e.g. body fat composition. A study found that over 96% of common drugs (like aspirin) are prescribed to women in too high doses leading to excess side effects.\r\n\r\n\u21e8 We misdiagnose women. Across 700 diseases women are on average diagnosed significantly later than men. For example, a woman having a heart attack is 50% more likely to get the wrong diagnosis due to differences in symptoms and sensitivity to commonly used diagnostics.\r\n\r\n\u21e8 We ignore female anatomy. It was only in 1998 that Helen O'Connell discovered that the clitoris is not just a tiny bulb at the top of the vulva but about a 10-cm long internal structure. That\u2019s almost 30 years after humans landed on Mars! Apparently, the vulva is more inaccessible than Mars.\r\n\r\nAlthough progress is evident, female-specific conditions remain secondary research subjects. Nowhere is this as clear as in the field of reproductive health. As of 2022, it takes on average 10 years to get diagnosed with endometriosis, an excruciatingly painful condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) starts to grow outside of the uterus. The cause and cure for endometriosis remain a mystery to modern medicine.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnd if you aren\u2019t convinced yet, in the last two decades we have churned 5.5x more studies about male infertility than female infertility. Not to mention that in 2019 alone, the number of publications on male erectile dysfunction surpassed studies on female fertility by nearly 6-fold. We have centuries worth of research to catch on to properly understand how the bodies of half of the world\u2019s population work.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need Repro Grants?\u00a0\r\n\r\nRelatively small sums of capital are directed towards supporting fundamental research for women\u2019s reproductive health. About 15% of all NIH funding goes to women\u2019s health (2018 data). This capital allocation does not take into consideration or intend to correct the hundreds of years lag in women\u2019s health research.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond the capital dilemma, the mechanisms for accessing funding are too slow. It is estimated that leading researchers spend up to 50% of their time writing grant applications. We want to offer an alternative; a fast and efficient process for getting access to crucial funding, so scientists can focus on what matters the most \u2014 doing the science. We are starting with a quick experiment; deploying $1M in Fast Grant Round 1. We will take the learnings and hope to increase the scale and velocity of the funding in future rounds.\r\n\r\nWho is behind Repro Grants?\u00a0\r\n\r\nSara Kemppainen: Self-educated sexual and reproductive health nerd.

		"description": "What is the idea behind Sciverse?\r\nImagine it is 1952, Rosalind Franklin is generating X-ray crystallographic images in King\u2019s College London. Two researchers at Cambridge, Francis Crick and James Watson, will eventually make use of one of these images (photo 51) to propose the famous double helical structure of DNA. We have built so many tools in genetic engineering that rely on this specific knowledge. What if in 1952, Watson and Crick could sell their [read Rosalind Franklin\u2019s] photo 51 to the science enthusiasts in a public auction? Would you collect it?\r\n\r\nNow, go back a little further in time to 1866: Gregor Mendel, a monk working in a monastery, published a work using peas to describe how the heredity is transmitted in discrete unit \u2014 this unassuming work would eventually form the foundation of genetics as we know it today. What if your great grandfather who was then a farmer with an interest in Mendel\u2019s work with peas bought the picture sold by Mendel in 1866? About 3 generations later you would realise that your great grandfather collected the original copy of one of the finest works of science in history.\r\n\r\nAny piece of original scientific finding auctioned in such a way at the time of the discovery will of course have a huge collectible value. Moreover, it gives back to science in a small way \u2014 for instance, it could have funded Mendel\u2019s next follow up experiments which he probably never got around doing because of lack of funds. Most importantly, this concept contributes to increasing public awareness and engagement in Science at a scale that was not possible before \u2014 by encouraging general public to actively participate in the ongoing research and collect the findings while giving back to the scientific community in whatever small way possible. This is now possible to implement easily as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have verifiable ownership and can be easily be stored, displayed, transferred and traded.\r\n\r\nAnother fun part is that unlike a lot of the projects creating artificial use cases for NFTs based on limited supply and artificial rarity in their collection, the Sciverse collection does not need such artificial scarcity or rarity elements associated with it\u2014 it naturally evolves over time based on how the underlying scientific works stand the test of time. Your collectible might win a Noble prize but it might also fail the rigour of scientific reproducibility \u2014 and only this will determine how sought after your collectible will be in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Sciverse collection about?\r\nSciverse selects the best contemporary scientific works and mints its representative art work (microscopic images or videos\/ piece of data\/ abstract illustration) as a collectible work of sciart. Every artwork represents a published digital object identifier (DOI) or equivalent. This artwork lives forever on a decentralised public blockchain for generations to see. This collection can be viewed here:\u00a0https:\/\/opensea.io\/thesciverse\r\n\r\nWhat is the Sciverse Museum?\r\nUsing the aforementioned collection, Sciverse organizes thematic (neuroscience to evolution to astronomy) exhibitions in the metaverse. This is organized in the Sciverse Museum, the first contemporary science museum in the metaverse:\u00a0https:\/\/thesciverse.xyz\/\r\n\r\nCurrently on display are the genesis pieces in the Genesis Hall which focus on the past. Moving forward, the focus will shift to the present \u2014 scientific works of today. With this, we are introducing an exciting new approach to science popularisation! The first two halls to open after the Genesis Hall are the Curie Hall and the Levi-Montalcini Hall which will be focussed on cancer\/ cell biology and neuroscience, respectively.\r\n\r\nWho can contribute to Sciverse?\r\nResearchers and artists can pitch any work published in 2021 or after to be part of the Sciverse collection of contemporary science. Researchers are welcome to submit their own works of science with a related image or media that they want us to use to represent the work. Artists are welcome to submit illustrations depicting a particular scientific discovery through an artist\u2019s eye. Here is the form to make a new submission:\u00a0https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLScxHtygAEe73nVPtw_0Iq-5PXOozYNoBm704YlsdB9Pg7EmIw\/viewform?usp=send_form\r\n\r\nHow do you plan to use the funds raised by selling the pieces?\r\nCurrently, we do not sell the sciart pieces. Our primary goal is to curate and display the best works of science for generations to see (no profit intended!).\r\nHowever, if and when your submission is sold, you will receive 90% of the primary sale proceeds to your ethereum address provided in the form. You can use this to do more cool science\/ sciart works if you like! We think giving funds back to the people who do amazing work is the best way to support innovation.\r\n\r\nAs for the remaining 10% , in the early days we hope that it will help Sciverse to self-sustain (it is currently a fully self-funded project at the time of writing). If and when Sciverse collection is able to move a lot of volume, we might use a part of the Sciverse treasury to fund public good projects related to science. Guess who will decide which project\/s to fund? The holders of the Sciverse collectibles, of course! In this way, we hope to become a thriving ecosystem for public engagement in science focussed on both science education and funding through sciart in the interconnected halls of the Sciverse.\r\n\r\nSounds interesting? Join us!\r\nSee you in the Sciverse.\r\n\r\n",

Our team has deployed the New Atlantis Living Oceans Metagenome Assembly Pipeline beta (LOMAP) which describes the full genome taxonomic profile and relative abundance of the planktonic species detected in DNA from ocean water samples.\u00a0 This\u00a0 creates ecological taxonomic \u201cfingerprints\u201d of the planktonic species present and can be used to gain insights into the structure and metabolic health of planktonic food webs.\u00a0 Plankton make up 90%+ of the biomass in the oceans and form the basis of marine biodiversity & marine food webs.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee below or our GitHub for details or to try out our colab notebooks.\u00a0 LOMAP beta includes the following:\r\n\r\nDecentralized Compute on Data architecture for next-gen DeSci workflows using large-scale metagenomics datasets and open AI\/HPC scaling tools such as Ray\r\nStable + reproducible cloud deployments and data storage through open protocols for reliable and scalable bioinformatics use\r\nUnified data platform for translational analysis and model building that enables an ensemble meta-omics approach to development of biodiversity metrics + analyses \r\n\r\nFuture developments will focus on cutting edge Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) that enables New Atlantis to scale massive full metagenome datasets while benefiting from declining cost curves in sequencing, storage, and cloud compute.\r\n\r\nPhoto used with permission by Paul Nicklen, co-founder of SeaLegacy.org, New Atlantis Founding Advisor, NatGeo Contributor, Instagram\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBIODIVERSITY QUANTIFICATION APPROACH: Quantifying marine biodiversity is a complex challenge that will ultimately require an ensemble of various open\u00a0 \u201cmeta-omics\u201d approaches.\u00a0 Below is a high level summary of our current thinking.\u00a0 Healthy marine ecosystems are a global public good.\u00a0 We invite the global ocean community to collaborate with us to improve our methodology and share in the value created.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMetagenomics: together with metabarcoding, metagenomics provides the foundational layer for biodiversity quantification of natural environments. Specifically,\u00a0 detailed taxonomic description and metabolic\/physiological potential of ecosystems can be achieved via metagenomics data analysis. See our beta MTG pipeline to learn more.\r\n\r\nBiodiversity Metamodel: Based on metagenomic datasets, we will extract a wide array of well established biodiversity indexes\/descriptors, which will be used as the starting point for building an open biodiversity metamodel framework. This will consist of an ensemble of different types of marine ecosystem biology models with various capabilities to integrate metagenomics-derived biodiversity indexes\/descriptors to compute confidence intervals for outputs associated with ecosystem health, including primary productivity, carbon sequestration efficiency and fish stock productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGR15 GRANT GOALS: GR15 grant proceeds will be used to expand development of our metagenome pipeline, develop initial DNA sampling programs in pilot MPAs, expand NGS infrastructure & support, and help develop open working groups for marine biodiversity standards and metamodel.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease consider making a grant to help support our efforts to provide the oceans with a viable business model by enabling marine biodiversity and blue carbon markets.\u00a0 We would love to give any of our donors a shoutout.\u00a0 If you want to come build with us, please check out our GitHub, Twitter,\u00a0 and

to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).\u00a0 We do this by building an open marine biodiversity analytics platform to monitor and forecast the health of Marine Protected Areas and from which marine biocredits and blue carbon credits can be generated.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese credits form the basis of a marine biodiversity market where MPAs can sell credits generated based on the biodiversity, biomass abundance, and life-driven blue carbon in their waters.\u00a0 \u00a0 This market provides MPAs with sustainable revenue streams that grow as conservation efforts and positive ecological outcomes increase.\u00a0 By providing MPAs with a viable business model that aligns with their core mission of ocean protection, New Atlantis can help scale marine biodiversity protection efforts worldwide while also enabling massive new markets for ocean ecological assets.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are using DeSci-driven metagenomics and related ecological modeling techniques combined with leading edge regenerative finance and web3 collaboration tools to build out the foundation of our open marine biodiversity analytics platform.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe know this is an enormous, ambitious undertaking.\u00a0 We don't think we can do this alone.\u00a0 So we are developing an open, collaborative platform that rewards meaningful contributions from ocean science, ReFi, DeSci (ReSci!!), conservation, and indigenous communities,\u00a0 as well as from ocean-concerned citizens.\u00a0 New Atlantis believes there is an opportunity to harness the collective intelligence of the global ocean community to align profit incentives with the protection + regeneration of the global marine biosphere. \u00a0\r\n\r\nOur goal is to make investing in the protection and expansion of sustainable marine ecosystems an extremely profitable global growth opportunity that can generate financial wealth for humans by improving the ecological health of the oceans.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe invite the global ocean community to come collaborate with us at discord.gg\/NewAtlantis\u00a0\r\n\r\n#DeSci, #ReFi and #ReSci ftw!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto used with permission by Cristina

below for an overview of our product\/platform development:\r\n\r\nThe NEW ATLANTIS LIVING OCEAN PROTOCOL will provide an open, globally scalable marine biodiversity analytics and forecasting framework.\u00a0 New Atlantis will provide the foundational infrastructure and modular design approach that facilitates open source development, incentivizes community contribution to build collective ocean intelligence, and enables integration of related ocean sciences data + models (ie GIS, metabolomics, proteomics, biogeochemistry, etc)\r\n\r\nPhase one of the Living Ocean Protocol is the New Atlantis Metagenome Pipeline Assembly as a platform for scalable marine ecosystem profiling and related ocean analytics + forecasting tools.\r\n\r\nPhase 1: METAGENOME ASSEMBLY PIPELINE beta- (completed)\u00a0 Assess baseline biodiversity of an ecosystem using eDNA (metabarcoding [MTB] and\/or metagenomic [MTG] sequencing) data to develop the planktonic taxonomic profile of an ecosystem. This tells us what plankton species are present in what relative abundance.\u00a0 See the output from the NA MTG Pipeline in Figure 1.\u00a0 See our GitHub for details and to check out our colab notebooks.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: EXPANDING DATASETS\/TIME SERIES + ADDING SPECIES-LEVEL MODELS: Add datasets and models focused on the functional traits of individual\u00a0 species within an ecosystem; enable 3rd party dataset + model pipeline additions.\u00a0 Productionize direct data collection pipelines.\u00a0 Begin open development of quantifying marine biodiversity and development of baseline metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhase 3: INTEGRATING MODELS INTO METAGENOME METAMODEL: Build food web models using\u00a0 taxonomies + functional traits across species and time.\u00a0 These models will be both used to gauge ecosystem health (ie preventative health screenings for MPAs) and to make projections about the future growth of those ecosystems.\u00a0 Expand work on biodiversity metrics including open development of a marine biodiversity unit of account.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhase 4: LIVING OCEANS PROTOCOL MODULAR PLATFORM: enable an open marine data protocol + access to ecological models for broad ocean analytics and\/or integration of related modular datasets + models (ie GIS, metabolomics, etc).\u00a0 Enable cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage 3rd party contribution of datasets and models into New Atlantis Living Oceans Protocol metamodel.\u00a0 Continuous improvement in biodiversity forecasting + granularity, expanded biodiversity tokenomics.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhase 5: MARINE BIODIVERSITY MARKETS: launch $BLU marine biodiversity token, enable MPAs to generate revenues\/tokens by quantifying- and valuing- the life and blue carbon in their areas.\u00a0 Enable profitable participation by the global ocean community in biodiversity markets\/ tokenomics in exchange for providing relevant datasets, models, capital, and conservation work + outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput from the New Atlantis Metagenome Pipeline using sample raw sequence public datasets to demonstrate pipeline.\u00a0 Sunburst plot illustrating the taxonomic composition identified in 10 different MTGs (indicated by color-coded sectors) from the TARA Ocean project.

That is what we do.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n-Paul Hawken, environmentalist, author, activist, New Atlantis Founding Advisor\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout MPAs, the ability of global ocean ecosystems to regenerate is severely limited.\u00a0 MPAs provide a necessary- and economically beneficial- way for nature to provide a sustainable future for both marine life and for humanity.\u00a0 Protecting and increasing ocean life protects us all.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we protect MPAs, the economic benefits will vastly outweigh the costs, generating new wealth for humanity, as well as providing food security, avenues for new pharmaceuticals, ecotourism, improved fisheries, and protection for coastal communities.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE BIODIVERSITY, CARBON, & CLIMATE CHANGE: WHY PROTECTING LIFE IN THE OCEANS IS CRITICAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto used with permission by Octavio Aburto, PhD, Professor of Biological Oceanography, Scripps, Founding New Atlantis Advisor,\u00a0 Instagram\r\n\r\n\u201cMapping the amount and richness of species and ecosystems, biodiversity, and valuing the services they provide to humanity, including carbon sequestration and storage, must be the base of our new economic systems.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n-Octavio Aburto, PhD, Professor of Biological Oceanography, Scripps, New Atlantis Founding Advisor\r\n\r\n\r\nOur world faces twin challenges from climate change and rapid biodiversity loss.\u00a0 These are both massive risks to the health and prosperity of our civilization as well as the ecological health of the planet. They are also deeply intertwined issues because loss of biodiversity not only reduces our ability to overcome climate change, it also threatens global life support systems like oxygen production, food production, and general ecological resilience.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of a 6th extinction and time is running out.\u00a0 But if we protect and expand biodiversity (and marine biomass), we can not only save the incredible beauty of our living oceans, we can build a more sustainable and abundant future.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto used with permission by Paul Nicklen, co-founder of SeaLegacy.org, New Atlantis Founding Advisor, NatGeo Contributor, Instagram\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe total value of biodiversity-driven ocean ecosystem services is valued at USD$ 29.5 trillion per year (Ocean and Climate Platform)\r\n\r\nSo how exactly does marine biodiversity help avoid climate change and provide so much economic benefit?\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond the priceless inherent value of the beauty in our living oceans, marine biodiversity serves humanity and the global biosphere in three primary ways:\r\n\r\nEcosystem Resilience:\u00a0 As Emmett Duffy, Director of the \u00a0Smithsonian Institution's Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network and MarineGEO program explains, \u201cThe more species\u2014or diversity\u2014you have in a system, the more that diversity buffers you from variation in the environment, just like a diverse stock portfolio buffers you from variance in the economy.\u201d\u00a0 IOW, biodiversity = resilience and we need that resilience to minimize how an increasingly volatile climate impacts our civilization.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMarine Ecosystem Services: Marine ecosystem services, such as storm or coastal erosion mitigation, viable\u00a0 fisheries, ecotourism, providing essential food sources for 3 billion people, 50% of global oxygen production, and bioprospecting for new products + medicines are some of the quantifiable benefits healthy marine ecosystems provide and upon which humanity depends.\u00a0 The ability of ecosystems to function is often directly dependent on the biodiversity of those ecosystems.\u00a0 Destroy the diversity and the ability to adapt and\/or provide those services is also diminished or destroyed.\u00a0 Ralph Chami, IMF economist and pioneer in the development of nature (biodiversity) markets estimates the value of global ocean biodiversity-driven ecosystem services to be ~$30 Trillion\/year.\u00a0 So, there is a LOT of value at risk if we fail to protect marine biodiversity BUT there is also tremendous wealth to be generated by creating markets that align value creation with marine ecological health.\r\n\r\nCarbon Storage + Sequestration:\u00a0 The oceans are estimated to hold 16X as much carbon as ALL terrestrial ecosystems and soil combined in long term storage.\u00a0 Additional carbon is sequestered in the oceans (aka \"blue carbon\") primarily thru either the \"physical pump\", a geochemical process where C02 dissolves directly in seawater, or the marine \"biological carbon pump\" where carbon is removed from the atmosphere by phytoplankton to photosynthesize. Because dissolving CO2 in seawater increases ocean acidification, the preferred sustainable and scalable way to sequester more carbon in the oceans is via the marine biological carbon pump.  As life in the oceans increases, more life is fixed in the living bodies of those marine organisms (life is made of carbon).\u00a0 Those organisms both poop and eventually die.  Their fecal pellets and dead bodies then sink to the bottom as carbon-rich \u201cmarine snow\u201d, eventually becoming part of the deep-sea sediment.\u00a0 In this way, carbon is \u201cpumped\u201d at massive scale to more permanent storage in the deep oceans where it can safely remain for centuries.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nAbrupt changes to biodiversity in marine ecosystems can ripple throughout the ocean\u2019s food chain and affect many other species, including humans. By understanding sources and drivers of marine biodiversity, we can better protect our marine ecosystems, the services they provide, and the ocean\u2019s ability to help us deal with climate change.\u00a0 Nature in the form of marine biodiversity can be humanity\u2019s partner to help us build a better, more healthy world.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto used with permission by Octavio Aburto, PhD, Professor of Biological Oceanography, Scripps, Founding New Atlantis Advisor,\u00a0 Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Focus on Plankton First?\r\nWhile they may seem inconsequential, plankton comprise 90% of marine biomass, are the main driver of the marine biological carbon pump, produce 50% of global oxygen, and are the foundation of the global food web. They are also incredibly diverse and provide much of the foundation for marine ecosystem resilience.\u00a0 Understanding healthy planktonic ecosystems is the key to scalable ecological resilience and the creation of marine biodiversity markets which can value life so that it can flourish to the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nOver time, we will expand to include organisms all the way up to whales in our MTG analyses but we are starting with the prime movers of ocean ecology, the small but mighty plankton\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto used with permission by Octavio Aburto, PhD, Professor of Biological Oceanography, Scripps, Founding New Atlantis Advisor, Instagram\r\n\r\n\u201cPhytoplankton are the original oxygenators of our planet and are central to sustainment of life in the ocean and on land. The profound loss of oxygen in the oceans is an accelerating condition. It accompanies and is worsened by climate change.

The only problem is, developers haven't yet really delivered the promise of web3 and blockchain powered solutions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have taken upon ourselves to start filling the gaps by developing privacy conscious siblings of the Web2 products. Shorty has a few basic features;\r\n1. URL shortener\r\n2. Self-destructing notes\r\n3. Scheduled private messages\r\n4. Developer API\r\n\r\nOn the above, only number 3 does not sound so obvious, let me explain. Imagine if you could send your future self a note and at the same be 100% sure that only you can open that message. The core of Shorty is a distributed smart contracts engine that uses multi-part computation to reconstruct that message you sent your future self. Let's look at a different use, you want to write your will but do not want other to read it before some given date. The Shorty smart contracts will lock up the message and they will not be able to reconstruct the will until all conditions have been satisfied(the wallet that minted the message can adjust the conditions though). This privacy is enforced through the concept of storing messages in the smart contracts themselves, as opposed to storing them on an external service and then pulling them per need.\r\n\r\n$SHORTS is a utility token used to pay for actions perfomed on the platform. Creating a short URL will cost $SHORTS, and so will creating self-destructing notes and scheduled messages. In addition, qouta for the developer API will also be given in $SHORTS. It necessarily is the currency of Shorty.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe would want to use funding to secure talent that is more experienced in cryptography and secure multiparty computation that we are. Our team is location in Harare, Zimbabwe.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## UPDATE - Sept 11, 2022\r\nWe are discussing with Sisu Network on how we can leverage their cross-chain functionality to widen the reach of shorty\r\n\r\n",

In the context of RPCs, end-users overloading a public RPC service, preventing others from using it too and reducing performance for all parties, pushing them towards private, usually centralized and rent seeking, providers.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOvergrazing without replenishment can lead to excess emissions resulting in sell-pressure, driving down the value of the POKT token and thereby the funds the DAO receives to maintain and improve the protocol - an increasingly problematic \"free-rider\" issue. To avoid a Tragedy of the Commons, the community can augment the public RPC good and produce a Festival of the Commons - creating another source of buy-pressure and strengthening the resiliency of the Pocket Network protocol.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor every 25K USD raised, Pocket Network can subsidize 50M daily relays for the web3 builders that make up their L1 and our communities.\r\n\r\nPocket Network Community\r\n\r\nPocket Network is an L1-agnostic community comprised of the brightest minds across web3, from your local independent node runner, to the founder of the next game-changing protocol, Pocket is powering the future of web3 with unstoppable, decentralized RPC infrastructure. Pocket Network Inc., Pocket Network Foundation and Pocket Network DAO, along with countless other contributors across the best chains in the business, are working together to ensure you have decentralized options for your entire web3 stack. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7135\/an-ens-web3-project-web3domainscom",
		"description": "1. Problem: ENS & Web3 Content \"Findability\"\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with the \"findability\" of ENS & Web3 content. There is not a lot of quality content available for new users entering Web3, or for existing users. This lack of quality content results in a lack of good websites or answers in search engines, like Google or DuckDuckGo. \r\n\r\nEveryday, new users are entering Web3, and they need to be able to find useful Web3 answers and helpful ENS content. It is critical that new users can find good data and quality content in search engines and via Web3 social media, which connects users and industry commentary, to point all users in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Solution: The \"Web3Domains.com\" Project\r\n\r\nWeb3Domains.com is a project seeking grants to pay content writers and other human resources to create content and publish information for \"Web3 users, Google SEO, and social media platforms\". The goals of the project are to drive awareness by increasing desired-searchable information, driving needed visibility in Google-SEO for topics related to \"decentralized domains, Web3 domains and identity\", with a particular focus on the ENS Protocol and the ENS DAO, and driving Web3 community discussion via social media platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Web3Domains.com project plans to simplify the discovery process for users new to the \"Web3, NFT\/Crypto, and Web3 Domain\" industries, by publishing timely and quality information across Web2 and Web3 social media platforms. These activities will include social-audio discussions via Twitter spaces and Clubhouse, to help raise awareness for users during their discovery process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Soft launch & Strategic Assets: Success & Strength\r\n\r\nNote: To date during our soft-launch, the Web3Domains.com project has connected with scores of independent Web3 content creators, and has published nearly two dozen articles from eight different Web3 writers and reporters. Not only has this provided several important pieces of content for new key subjects, but this has also contributed to eight new builder-creators, working independently in the Web3 and ENS industry.\r\n\r\nThe main domain, web3domains.com, is a strategic asset as it contains the exact match for one of the industry's most important SEO keywords. This will help new users find needed information more easily during their discovery-journey. Web3Domains.com will serve the \"Web3, NFT\/Crypto, & Domain\" industries, with a focus on the intersection between Metaverse and NFTs with Web3 Domains, such as the ENS protocol.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Project S.W.O.T.: Advantages & Challenges \r\n\r\nCompetitors for content generation are thin for Web3 domains, specifically, so the primary competitors for the Web3Domains.com website come from the broader crypto-publications, are other content generating websites, which focus on the crypto industry in general.\r\n\r\nWeb3Domains.com has a competitive advantage over these websites in several areas.\r\nFirst, Web3Domains.com has a strong focus on decentralized domains and web3 domains, while its competitors have a broader focus on the crypto industry as a whole.\r\nSecond, Web3Domains.com has a team with experience in marketing-technology, giving an edge in content creation and SEO.\r\nThird, Web3Domains.com has premium domain name assets, which will help it to be more visible in search engine results.\r\nFinally, Web3Domains.com has a standing in the Web3 industry, which gives it access to timely and quality information.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWeb3Domains.com may face some challenges when entering the marketplace.\r\nFirst, the project is competing against well-established websites with large audiences.\r\nSecond, the project is focused on a niche market, which may make it difficult to attract a broad audience.\r\nThird, the project is new to the industry and may not have the same level of credibility as its competitors.\r\nHowever, the project plans to overcome these challenges by producing high-quality content, using SEO to improve its visibility, and building relationships with key players in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Project Team: Founding Members \r\n\r\nThe project is led by Gary Palmer Jr. (GaryPalmerJr.eth), CEO, \r\nand Adriana Skura-Palmer (AKA: Ada.eth; UnfoldedLife.eth), COO.\r\nGary Palmer Jr. is a serial entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in marketing, sales, and business development, working with startups and enterprise Fortune 1,000 companies, mostly in the technology or the traditional-payments\/POS industries. He is the co-founder of two startups, with experience working in the blockchain industry.\r\nAdriana Skura-Palmer is a serial entrepreneur with over 15 years of experience in marketing, operations, communications, and business development. She is traditionally trained artist, photographer, photo researcher, and the [female, woman led] co-founder of two startups, with experience working in the blockchain-crypto and Web3-NFT industries.\r\nWeb3Domains.com's management team has a wealth of experience in marketing, sales, business development, and technology. This experience will be instrumental in the Web3Domains.com's ability to generate awareness.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Conclusion & Gratitude: Web3 is strong, together\r\n\r\nThe Web3Domains.com project will meet the news and content needs of individuals and organizations, interested in decentralized domains, Web3 domains, and Web3 identity. The website will be educational and informative, with a focus on content creation, SEO, social media marketing, and Web3 community building.\r\n\r\nPlease consider donating\u2014Even as little as $1.00 can go a LONG way! \r\nWe Thank You for reviewing our proposal, and for your consideration <3\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "What is it?\r\nEthPay is the first and only complete anonymous and decentralized ERC-20 payment gateway.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTraditional De-fi payment gateways first collect funds into a centralized De-Fi wallet, and then it is up to them to withdraw the money to your wallet or not. This problem is a giant hole in every De-Fi payment gateway, and We fix this hole by decentralizing every single transaction from sender to receiver.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEthPay facilitates any developer, even without blockchain development knowledge, to implement De-Fi payment methods to their web applications from EthPay API. And the EthPay Link feature makes your payments to make them from a single click. This technology minimizes QR scanning and public key copy and pasting just to click and pay level. Also, this may help avoid mistakes and fraud during transaction procedures. EthPay is the next-level ERC-20 payment option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly ERC-20?\r\nNo, EthPay 1 - Beta is the first look of the EthPay technology, and we are on the way to expanding other ERC transactions such as ERC-721 & etc. at EthPay 2. EthPay 3 will cover the entire ecosystem by adding other Ethereum coins.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDecentralized\r\nEthPay is not like a traditional payment gateway. It does not use any third-party wallets to collect and withdraw funds. EthPay transfers the transaction directly from the sender wallet to the receiver wallet in real time.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAnonymity\r\nThe data we store are public keys and other public information such as txHashes and block numbers to process and validate your transactions. We do not collect any personal information except the above, such as your IP addresses, Names, Emails, Passwords & etc., directly. That is our commitment to privacy and anonymity.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Technology\r\nWe developed an algorithm to validate ERC-20 EthPay API transactions reliably. In this technology, we used an ABI to store pre-defined 256-bit code at the blockchain along with the transaction as input data. EthPay validation protocol checks this input with our database to verify the transaction. And we give you a secret code to validate transactions in your web application too and the secret code is secured as your wallet\u2019s private key is secure.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo, for what do you grant?\r\nWe have currently released the first technical preview of EthPay 1. EthPay technology is set to expand through three stages (EthPay 1, EthPay 2 & EthPay 3).\r\n\u00a0\r\nEthPay 3 will be the best available payment solution for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. EthPay expands the Ethereum eco-system to the developers and users who already haven\u2019t been involved with ERC transactions. And the main point is, that ERC is the most sustainable transaction option you can click at the checkout. And you are contributing to making EthPay 3 real!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb: https:\/\/ethpay-beta.netlify.app\r\nAPI Guide: https:\/\/ethpay-beta.netlify.app\/guide\r\nAbout: https:\/\/ethpay-beta.netlify.app\/about\r\n\r\n",

They will drop once every two weeks, promoting Loot as a shared universe and the Genesis Scrolls project as a collaborative writing exercise. \r\n\r\nMusic from the Minstrels and Bard of the Hyperverse projects will be used for introductions so the podcast will serve as a way to promote and distribute the music of the Lootverse as well as its fiction.\r\n\r\nAn audio book version of the Genesis Scrolls will not only be delightful in itself, but will make the Loot fiction it tells more accessible to a wider audience, including those with sensory loss or dyslexia.\r\n\r\nWe will also be able to tie the audio versions to the stories contained within the Eye (for Adventurers), strengthening the case for on-chain storytelling and paving the way for others to include high quality audio readings of the stories across the Librarium.\r\n\r\nI have received quotes from voice actors and a recording studio in my area and can break down the total costs as follows:\r\n\r\nActors cost \u00a3250 for one day of recording, totalling eight hours.\r\nThere will be ~50 stories in the final Genesis Scrolls books.\r\nThe actors estimate they could record 4 stories each day, so will need to be hired for 12.5 days.\r\nActor costs = \u00a33150 \/ $3720\r\n\r\nThe studio hire costs \u00a320 an hour.Eight hours for those 12.5 days would be 100 hours.\r\nStudio costs = \u00a32000 \/ $2362\r\n\r\nMastering and production is quoted as \u00a330 per track \/ story\r\nProduction costs = \u00a31500 \/ $1772\r\n\r\nHosting will be done on Buzzsprout, for $12 \/ month for 12 months.\r\nHosting costs = $144\r\n\r\nSo total costs amount to: \u00a36797 \/ $8028\r\n\r\nIf we undershoot the target funding in this round, we will produce as many episodes as the funding will allow. The minimum cost to produce a mini-series would be that of hosting, one day of recording and the production of 4 stories.\r\n This would be $674.\r\n\r\nIf we overshoot the target funding we will commission original music for the show, and mint the show as NFTs on a blockchain suitable for audio projects.\r\n\r\n",

An initial ~6-12 month program design phase that takes ~$200k to pay for program manager salary, travel, and discipline-spanning technical workshops\r\n2. A number of parallel 12-18 month proof-of-principle projects that prove out key components of the technology and suggest which of several paths are most promising. In total, these projects require ~$1.5m.\r\n3. The full program, which runs another ~$8m.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe currently have two active programs in the design phase and are looking to start several others.\r\n\r\nThese numbers are obviously much larger than a normal Gitcoin grant, but every bit helps!\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrevious Work\r\nResearch takes a long time and we are new, but to get a sense of our thinking and ability to execute you may want to see our pieces on how DARPA works, how to build a private ARPA, or our Substack where we share learnings from the process of building out the organization.\u00a0\r\n\r\n",

These initiatives may be directly political in nature, such as our plan to establish an advocacy group to engage in direct and\/or grassroots lobbying; they may be cultural, such as leading public discussion panels about important topics facing DAOs; or they may be industrial, helping coordinate projects between coalition members.\r\n\r\nBecause DAOs span a wide array of sectors and applications, the coalition itself may end up taking an ultimately decentralized organizational structure - perhaps even becoming a DAO itself, or a metaDAO. In this sense, the aforementioned coordinational network may function as a matrix to birth DAO-led initiatives pertaining to a given sector.\r\n\r\nHypotheticals aside, any prospects of donation implore the question of what the DAO Coalition will be doing with proceeds.

Using virtual land nft as a carrier, information and knowledge can be displayed on the land, so as to solve the current shortcomings of artificial intelligence.\r\n       The development of super aggregators will have several processes. At present, in view of the complexity of social media information, corporate information with the problems of information security, people and even personal information cannot be well displayed on limited social personal pages, as well as information security and other issues, especially for many projects of web3, there is a lot of timely updated information that needs to be updated. Users know, but due to the lack of a good presentation form, for us, olandbox figured out whether we can do a link aggregation, and gradually complete the goal of the super aggregator by implementing one aggregation by one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat it does  \r\n    The name of the information aggragation Blue Soul. Olandbox Blue Soul is a functional development based on the original land mint of olandbox. \r\n    As a linktree in the web3 world, it currently has the functions of personal information integration and link aggregation, and will open more functional modules in the future. According to the basic division of land, the corresponding areas will be divided into public space, official space, and private space. \r\n    Currently, Blue Soul will first be deployed in the official space.The main function division of Blue Soul will be divided into official space editing content, links, combined with land use to form a map.\r\n\r\n    Olandbox Blue Soul Link: https:\/\/mint.oland.info\/olandbox.v\r\n\r\n    There are several founctions of Blue Soul:\r\n  In addition to solving the problem of link aggregation, the function of information aggregation has been added; \r\n  Support users to add QR codes, personal display pictures, texts, etc., emphasizing user attributes, and meeting various usage scenarios;\r\n  Use the wallet to log in, which has the function of decentralization and solves the hidden danger of easy leakage of personal information;\r\n Blue Soul supports that the domain name customization, personal information sharing page can be connected with olandbox semantic land, which can fully meet the user's usage scenarios;\r\n  Multi-language settings can meet the needs of friends from all over the world, if a project has official accounts in multiple languages, they just need to use one link of Blue Soul which can add different languages in is enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   6.For the project sides, they can also get Blue Soul vertification by contacting to olandbox, so their links will have the logo and the domain name of their sharing link will be different. Also, projects who have olandbox Blue Vertification can get the authority of zero-knowledge access, which means that the users can use the 'project name'+'attribute' to search the information of the project. \r\n      For example, if you want to search for olandbox dc, you just need to type the infor on your chorm: https:\/\/mint.oland.info\/olandbox.dc.en \r\n   \r\n     That's the basic founction of Blue Soul now. At the same time, the link will also show the users' semantic land on olandbox. If people click the link, they can firsly check the link, picture and text on their profie, and later they can click the land information to see more about the land owners. And the owners can add the all the content into his private space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n Accomplishments that we're proud of\r\n    We have acomplished two bata test already. And people can mint land now, at the same time, there are over 2000+ senmantic lands minted, which shows the supports and approvel.\r\n    Also, olandbox has started business on Opensea.\r\n    Besides, there are over 50 projects and 200 kols in our community. And the projects side are our collabration partners who got Blue Vertification, which also means they are using Blue Soul link to present the information of their projects.\r\n\r\n What's next for Olandbox \r\n Firstly, we will acomplish the functions of Blue Soul. The function of link  aggragation,  multi-language, supprting the users to add picture and text.\r\n We will add the these fouction in the near furure:\r\n In the future, the time setting will be supported, so that the project party can clearly mark the event time, and users can also set reminders according to the corresponding reminder time to generate an exclusive calendar;\r\n For users, subscription notifications will be added in the future, including project credit changes, content changes, etc., and corresponding time reminders can be added;\r\nIn the future, support the chain, as a protocol, bind the use of other dapps;\r\n Besides, we will also develop a new application into olandbox called Meta ID card, which can be the authentication of individuals on web3. \r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\u00a0Olandbox is trying to be a super aggregator in web3, which is updated version of wiki.\u00a0Since inception, it has been widely enjoyed by the community and has seen strong engagement. We believe that Blue Soul and another applications of olandbox will benefit the community at large.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0And now, we are trying to create the functions of wallet bounding and zero-knowledge access, which will make a big progress of our community. We also believe it can help to build a better environment in Web3.\r\n\r\nAll about olandbox: \r\n    Blue Soul Link: https:\/\/mint.oland.info\/olandbox.v\r\n    Olandbox Website: https:\/\/home.oland.info\r\n    Olandbox twitter: https:\/\/mint.oland.info\/olandbox.twitter.en\r\n    Olandbox Discord:https:\/\/mint.oland.info\/olandbox.dc.en",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7162\/the-longevity-decentralized-review-tldr-by-vitada",
		"description": "The Longevity Decentralized Review (TLDR) is an on-demand peer review service. Website: https:\/\/longevity.review. It addresses critical issues with academic journals:\r\nResearchers should be able to obtain peer reviews of their work in a timely and fair fashion.\r\nReviewers should have the option of being compensated for their efforts.\r\nThe general public shouldn't have to wait for research to be published in a journal to know whether it's credible.\r\nJournals should not profit off the free labor of researchers.\r\nTLDR will not interfere with the status quo. It is an opt-in mechanism for researchers to get extra eyes on their work.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\nHow does TLDR work?\r\nTLDR provides funding for researchers to review each other's work. There is a free and paid tier. Articles from websites known as \u201cRxiv\u201d (pronounced \u201carchive\u201d) preprint servers, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and Arxiv are auto-posted daily to the homepage. The incentive for peer reviewing these freely posted manuscripts is to receive a share of the donations given to TLDR. See the Donate page to donate. The paid tier differs in that it allows researchers to post their work directly to have it reviewed. Paying places a \"Paid\" label next to the submission. Researchers pay a subscription (see below for details) to keep their manuscript(s) part of the paid tier. Reviewers have extra incentive to review paid manuscripts because they not only receive a portion of the total donations but also a portion of the total subcriptions. Because VitaDAO is supplementing the reviewers with its $VITA token, the initial focus of both the free and paid tiers are on longevity related research.\r\n\r\nWhere does the research come from posted on the TLDR homepage?\r\nThe research is posted from the researchers themselves and from the preprint servers, Biorxiv, MedRxiv, and Arxiv. We especially want people to link to their research on the preprint servers. These \"Rxiv\" websites enable anyone to submit their research in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, medicine) disciplines for free. This is helpful because not every can afford to publish in traditional academic journals. Currently, we are focusing on biology-related manuscripts (e.g., Arxiv \"q-bio\" and \"physics.bio-ph\") but we potentially will expand.\r\n\r\nHow does peer review work on TLDR and how does it differ from traditional peer review?\r\nTLDR reviewing is similar to traditional peer reviewing in terms of its emphasis on rigor and in judging for importance. However, it differs in that it is quantitative. The ranking of each work is based on upvotes by ones peers. It is similar to how it's done at Hacker News. Also, the reviews are ranked by upvotes. Anyone can review a work by clicking \"Write review\" under each manuscript.\r\n\r\nWe believe TLDRs have value when compared to traditional reviews because though they will likely be shorter than traditional peer reviews, they can be faster and the voting can enable a broader consensus. This contrasts with traditional peer review that is performed by a relative small number of people (2-4).\r\n\r\nAll this being said, we are always open to suggestions on how to facilitate a better peer review environment.\r\n\r\nHow does how the reviews get evaluated affect how they get paid?\r\nResearchers can evaluate the reviews using upvoting and commenting. This feedback will help reviewers grow their reputation and will determine their payouts.\r\n\r\nHow are donations handled?\r\nTLDR gives the donations we receive to the researchers who peer review. A small fraction of the donations go to operating the TLDR organization, as is needed to pay staff salaries and maintain this website. We use Stripe for our credit card processing and Coinbase for our cryptocurrencies. Please donate here. We support the following digital currency donations:\r\n\r\nBitcoin (BTC): 36DkutW1QKHSiN9xuGakQaaKThWrhTBBRH\r\nEthereum (ETH): 0x99B75a632567ce5A86eDE922E23D1B052136192d\r\nUSD Coin (USDC): 0x3344fcA91ecdBDb7c919Ae91C0a9a8F1d63a1Ab3\r\n\r\nCan you log in under a pseudonym? Can people see my activity on the site?\r\nYes, you can log in under a pseudonym. There's no restrictions on who can use the site. Your reviews and donations are anonymous. All content is anonymous. We feel this is important to promote free expression. That being said, those who are abusive towards others will have their accounts and comments delisted. Also, if you will make a donation or pay for a review using a credit card, we are required by our payment processor to collect your email.\r\n\r\nWhat is the problem that TLDR addresses?\r\nPublishing in journals especially in the biomedical sciences has significant issues. Journals historically provided an important function in physically printing research manuscripts. However, now with the internet anyone can make their work accessible by posting it online. Researchers are now doing this at preprint servers as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe remaining major distinction between a journal and any website on the internet is that journals have peer review. Peer review is the process of scientists reviewing each other\u2019s work to determine if the work is worthy of publishing. In most cases, scientists recommend other scientists with similar domain expertise to a journal to review their work. Scientists then often spend many hours assessing the quality of results and suggesting changes. Often, there can be several rounds of revision.\r\n\r\nThis is a system that benefits the world that scientists take pride in, with one major issue \u2013 The journals do not pay scientists for any of this work. Rather, the journals charge large and growing fees (many $thousands) to scientists for the privilege of publishing in their journals. The journals have little costs because scientists do most of the work for free. This results in journals having massive profit margins. Some estimates have journals outdoing the profit margins even of some of the most successful companies on earth such as Apple.\r\n\r\nTo recap, the common scenario is scientists pay journals from their increasingly inadequate non-profit funding sources to have other scientists do free labor reviewing for for-profit journals. It is widely acknowledged by many that this is an unacceptable exploitative system that needs to change.\r\n\r\nHow does the paid tier subscription pricing work?\r\nYou can subscribe as a logged in user at Billing. Pricing tiers:\r\nOne (1) manuscript kept live as a paid submission: $29\/month, $249\/year\r\nTwo (2) manuscripts kept live as paid submissions: $49\/month, $499\/year\r\nFive (5) manuscripts kept live as paid submissions: $99\/month, $999\/year\r\n\r\nWhat are tags?\r\nTags are keywords and phrases that you can track in preprints such that you can receive emails when they are found. You can track your tags here. We realize you might not want to check this site regularly, so being emailed of your tags seems a solution to that.\r\n\r\nHow can I stop being notified by email of new reviews on my manuscripts or on manuscripts I've reviewed?\r\nIf the new review is on your manuscript, please go to your Projects page to manage your email preferences. If the new review is on a manuscript you reviewed, please go to your Reviews page to manage your email preferences.\r\n\r\nHow does one get paid to do peer reviews?\r\nYou get paid using $VITA tokens. Please include your ERC-20 address on your \"Profile\" when you are logged in. In the future we plan to use log in with a web3 wallet and to do away with the email requirement.\r\n\r\nWho developed TLDR? And what does TLDR refer to?\r\nTLDR was created by Tim R Peterson and colleagues. TLDR is an acronym that stands for The Longevity Decentralized Review. Tim is an Assistant Professor at Washington University School of Medicine. The TLDR is not affiliated with Washington University.\r\n\r\nWhat will my Gitcoin donation go towards?\r\nCurrently, the proof of concept website, https:\/\/longevity.review is purely Web2 with email log-in, off-chain transactions, and data storage. We will use the Gitcoin funds to implement a wallet log-in, storing of the reviews and their associated manuscripts via IPFS or Arweave, and enable voting on the reviews that will determine how much each reviewer receives to be done on-chain. The latter will allow wallets to grow their reputation.\r\n\r\nFuture plans\r\nTo help the DeSci movement more broadly, we are also developing Proof Of Peer Review (PoP Review), https:\/\/proofofpeer.review, to accommodate more general biomedical research. Our intent is to make a Web3 version of the StackExchange network by having several sister sites like TLDR and PoP Review where different types of research is being evaluated. One can image, these sister sites using different tokens besides $VITA from other DAOs. \r\n\r\nQuestions?\r\nPlease reach out! We'd love to talk with you. hi@longevity.review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Later, cXc, created the first implementation of a biomimetic economy called PURPLE. Now, these contracts are being developed in public, and seeking support on Gitcoin. We are looking for coders to help take these concepts to solidity + rust, help reviewing out C++ contracts, and to mouths to spread the idea of Biomimetic Economies.\r\n\t\r\n\tBiomimetic Contract Preview\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThank you for your support.\r\n\r\n",

We anticipate that many AMM protocols will be announced on StarkNet over time, as StarkNet is a validity Rollup that ensures Ethereum security and also allows very cheap transaction fees.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is great but comes with a few problems. Many AMM protocols have been announced on StarkNet and due to the distribution of liquidity to many AMMs, it is a bad user experience for the end user to find the one that gives the most liquidity and the best ratio among these AMM protocols.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is where Fibrous comes into play. Instead of navigating the AMM that gives the best rate one by one manually, Fibrous allows users to swap the best rate with one click in the cheapest way without giving any extra effort.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJust swap with best price possible in StarkNet. Fibrous aggregates all AMMs of StarkNet in one place.",

		"description": "In particular, in the case of the exhaust system, it should function correctly to guarantee the proper exhaustion of extra harmful gases so that the engine can carry out the combustion process. Otherwise, the engine might become clogged, which could hinder the combustion process and eventually affect the vehicle's overall performance.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut it's a good idea to be aware of exhaust system flaws. Here is a quick breakdown of exhaust-related issues.\r\n\r\nA Malfunctioning Oxygen Sensor Fails To Intimate The ECU Properly.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen sensor is used by the exhaust system to collect data about the gases that are supposed to be released into the environment.\u00a0When the task is finished, the ECU starts the internal combustion process.\r\n\r\nThe ECU, on the other hand, fails to produce the proper air-to-fuel ratio if there is any malfunctioning. As a result, the combustion chamber does not receive the proper fuel, and the process has a good chance of going wrong.\u00a0\r\nEither mixture could heat up too much or the combustion chamber converts energy inefficiently. It even damages the catalytic converter and causes the engine to misfire on occasion.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA sensor failure is a difficult problem to diagnose, though. Engine misfiring initially appeared to be an issue with the engine.\u00a0\r\nHowever, you can speak with a specialist at Service My Car to get the right assessment of the problem and the right fix for the same.\r\n\r\nExhaust Smoke Hints At Some Underlying Issue\r\n\r\nIt is normal for combustion to produce smoke. However, it should be colourless, as coloured smoke is a sign of trouble.\u00a0There could be grey, white, blue, or black smoke.\u00a0The coloured smoke, however, typically arises from some flaws in the combustion process.\r\n\r\nThe blue smoke is typically created when engine oil burns inside the engine. Because of worn valves, cylinder walls, or a faulty head gasket, engine oil may leak into the combustion chamber.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOn the other hand, black smoke results from the engine using more fuel than it should. The main cause of these problems turns out to be a clogged air or fuel filter. However, you can opt for an air filter replacement at a reliable service centre to counter the issue. If the smoke is white or grey in colour, coolant leakage is to blame.\r\n\r\nExhaust Leakage May Result From the Presence of Malodorous Inside Cabins\r\n\r\nThere are many chances for leakage into the system manifold or even one of the joints throughout the exhaust system, which extends from the front to the rear and heavily relies on the pipes.\r\n\r\nHowever, a leak at the manifold poses a threat because it could let toxic fumes into the cabin while the engine makes loud noises.\r\n\r\nSince toxic gases in smoke are purified by the catalytic converter but escape due to leakage, the passenger may be in danger of dying as a result of the leak.\r\n\r\nA Failed Catalytic Converter May Hamper the Engine's Performance\r\n\r\nHowever, a failed catalytic converter could cause issues if it becomes clogged or damaged as a result of overheating. The catalytic converter does the trick of converting the dangerous gases into safe steam to release into the environment. Sometimes, the converter is exposed to emissions containing substances that coat the working surfaces, catalyst poisoning happens.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMany times, drivers ignore the warning signs of a failing catalytic converter and believe their car is still in good condition.\u00a0However, most of the vehicles on the road today use catalytic converters. These devices have almost become a requirement for new cars.\r\n\r\nBut, there is a serious issue with wear and tear on these expensive units, which are frequently unable to prevent damage due to the negative effects of gasoline. A defective catalytic indirectly impacts the engine of a vehicle as it hampers the combustion chamber. There is also some sort of improper fuel efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever, a proactive approach might save you more effort and time in terms of car engine repair.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary Vibrations Are Not Healthy For A Safe Drive\r\n\r\nYou may be feeling vibrations around your steering wheel as a result of an unhealthy exhaust system. Sometimes the entire vehicle feels these vibrations, which is not a good sign for a safe drive.\r\n\r\nYou don't anticipate seeing a car causing trouble on the road. However, if you choose to seek a professional assessment and do not ignore such problems, there is a lower likelihood that something will go wrong.\r\n\u00a0\r\nExhaust System Rust and Loose Hangers\r\n\r\nRust is a true enemy to the exhaust system as it hampers it slowly until it goes bad and starts to pose an issue. However, this is common in vehicles that do not get enough rides. The water vapours do not get enough time to burn off.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBesides, the exhaust system stays with your car with the help hangers. But a loose or broken hanger is not a good sign for a vehicle's exhaust system. If you need any type of car service & repair, service my car provides you free pickup and delivery at the nearest Mercedes Benz service bolton center.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe exhaust problems may be avoided by taking preventive measures. It requires you to inspect the exhaust system once or twice a year. However, you can ask for a professional's help during the car maintenance to identify the causes and address them properly.\r\n\r\nService My Car offers distinctive services and solutions for all of your automotive needs.

ThreeOh DAO has seized this moment in history to create the first DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that is mission driven to shape regulatory policy in the United States and beyond on behalf of grassroots Web3 and DeFi users. ThreeOh DAO is focused on impacting the crypto policy on behalf of users. ThreeOh DAO is the voice of the Web3 Community, providing our community and Web3 the opportunity to impact the framework that will ultimately define the parameters for access and exclusion within the new global financial system. \r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity for investors to be the change they want to see in the world.\r\n\r\nCompany summary: ThreeOh DAO is the first organization designed to actively engage policymakers through lobbying and education on behalf of the Web3 community. Through 501(c)(4) relationships with two lobby and policy teams (Fintech and Strategic Communications), affiliated non-profit 501(c)(3), and a Super PAC, ThreeOh DAO has built the necessary infrastructure tasked with the challenge of regulatory policymaking on behalf of the global Web3 community. As referenced in a recent Politico https:\/\/www.politico.com\/newsletters\/digital-future-daily\/2022\/06\/06\/a-dao-has-a-pac-and-its-spooky-00037527, 3OH is the only DAO in the United States that has a registered Super PAC.\r\n\r\nMission statement: 3OH DAO strives to become the trusted voice of Web3 to government officials in DC and around the globe.Together, we\u2019ll educate policymakers on the transformative benefits of blockchain technology and work to champion policies to advance the Web 3 community.\r\n\r\nMarket: Our target audience is made up of web3 users and supporters that are passionate about the sustainability and long-term success DeFi and Web3, and the development of Web3 friendly regulatory policy that fosters and enables growth and adoption. \r\n\r\nThreeOh DAO serves every organization, token, and ecosystem in Web3. Utilizing a successful marketing strategy from a respected voice in Web3 will seize and capitalize on this aspect of ThreeOh DAO.\r\n\r\n20% of the grant funding will be dispersed to our 501c3, DeFi Education. This is an IRS approved 501c3 with the mission of educating policymakers, staffers, and regulatory bodies on the benefits of digital assets and blockchain technologies. \r\n30% of the grant funding will be allocated for marketing and strategic exchange partnerships. ThreeOh DAO is resolute in its mission to bring the voice of Web3 users to the regulatory tables that are forming throughout the US. Through the use of this allocation, we believe we will be able to attract new DAO membership and increase our DAO's influence over the regulatory processes taking place in Washington, DC. \r\n30% of the grant funding allocations will be utilized for the formation an International DAO Coalition based in Dubai, UAE, by utilizing Dubai's \"commerce free zone.\" These free zones allow for organizations to create international business subsidiaries without the requirement of residency.\r\n20% of the grant funding will be allocated for international marketing and advocacy partnerships. Through our relationship with Runway Strategies, we have access to their international policy\/advocacy expert, Joanne Marques. Joanne currently lives abroad and has 20+ years of experience working with international policy and advocacy initiatives. Through the connections Joanne has built, we will be able to connect with governments and DAO organizations alike to create an international advocacy powerhouse with the mission of supporting Web3 expansion across the world.\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Bring your own tool. Own your own data. Stay on the SamePage.\r\n\r\nEveryone has their own tool for note-taking. SamePage brings them together as an intra-TFT network. You use Roam while they use Obsidian, and SamePage syncs changes across your team without needing to leave your custom setup. DeSci is driven on protocols like SamePage. Give your team a way to share knowledge without barriers. \r\n\r\nAt this stage, we have raised $48k from Filecoin Network Goods Dev Grants. We are seeking grant funding to build out the next stage of the SamePage Network. \r\n\r\nSamePage Stage 1 Milestone 2 Demo - Watch Video\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs seen above, today we have a functional sync between Roam graphs, Logseq graphs, and Roam-to-Logseq graphs with data stored in IPFS. This gives collaborators a way to work together without needing to leave their environment or give their data to another third party.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDavid and Joel\u2019s work building the Discourse Graph RoamJS plugin laid the foundation for this project. We believe synthesizing knowledge and collaborating on discourse graphs to be the first major application for research teams to use SamePage. This project goes a step further to accelerate the creation of research public goods, particularly those suited for decentralized collaboration and science.\u00a0\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\n\r\nTools for thought (TFTs) are applications that are meant to augment human intelligence by providing quick capture of ideas via notes and free association of these ideas via links and references. The space is currently littered with plenty of different web2 options, from Roam to Obsidian, Notion to Logseq. \r\n\r\nEach of the companies behind these products believe that their specific data model and bundle of user interfaces will be the solution to solving personal knowledge management, and some believe they could grow into the solution that solves collective knowledge management.\r\n\r\nHowever, all users are different and have highly specific needs. This has played out by Notion and Roam starting as the primary two tools of choice, and slowly losing power users to the newer entrants in the space. As users continue to migrate between tools and settle into their preferred UI and servers of choice, collaborating has gotten increasingly difficult. In order for teams of researchers or independent contractors to collaborate, they either need to a) compromise into using one tool, copy\/pasting data back and forth from their personal tool or b) import\/export data from their personal tool to the personal tools of their colleagues.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, tools for thought on their own will not be a sufficient answer for collaborative thought. What we need instead is a protocol for thought: a set of decentralized computing resources and adapters from each of these tools. A network that allows users to continue sketching ideas in their personal tool for thought and that tool interfacing with the tools of their colleagues directly.\r\n\r\nAn example use case: I want to be able to open a page in Roam and have it connect directly with a page in another user's Obsidian vault. We can write changes to the same document asynchronously and they will be resynchronized once connected to the internet.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we plan to develop SamePage, a network composed of a series of stateless lambda functions that will use IPFS as the file storage backend. To help inform the design of the protocol for communicating with this network, we will implement a series of plugins for a set of the previously mentioned tools for thought. In our MVP, we are connecting:\r\nRoam\r\nObsidian\r\nLogseq\r\nIn the future, we will extend the network to also connect:\r\nNotion\r\nEvernote\r\nAthens\r\nRemnote\r\nAnd more\r\n\r\nValue\u00a0\r\n\r\nSuccessfully building out this network would allow teams of people to collaborate with each other without having to all migrate to a single platform. A research lab could have one member in Roam, one in Obsidian, and one in LogSeq, and still be able to share one lab notebook of findings without any of them compromising on their tool of choice. This would provide users of these tools an alternative to the current export=>import=>reformat workflow with the ability to interface with each other directly. Since the proliferation of new tools for thought in 2019, the unserved need to connect work across different software platforms grows.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThrough Joel and Brendan's prior research, they've seen this problem repeatedly \u2014 it's hard to bring others up to speed, especially when team members use different tools. Even then, when teams don't share the same vocabulary, struggles occur to introduce new team members to a project. David has already made strides to solve this later problem, introducing a multiplayer connection within Roam that allows for different users to share pages \u2014 and their surrounding context \u2014 to enable teams to collaborate with reduced friction.\r\n\r\nThe primary user groups we are targeting are those collaborating around either a problem or set of tasks. The former often involves research groups with labs composed of members synthesizing their research on their own tools and currently struggling to find a way to combine their findings and build off of each other. The latter involves freelancers and agencies who are looking to reduce friction around onboarding new clients by allowing each party to stay in their company\u2019s tool of choice.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFunding for Upcoming Milestones\r\n\r\nThe funding we're seeking will pay our core contributors and allow us to expand to bring on additional team members - a community leader, content marketer, and engineers. \r\n\r\nWe've outlined our goals at each milestone along with projected resources.\r\n\r\nStage 1: Initial MVP - completed in November 2022\r\nHave a prototype that syncs changes between a Roam graph, a logseq graph, and an Obsidian vault\r\nLooking for four months of development to sprint towards this MVP\r\nDavid + Brendan will work on this alone\r\nFunding secured: $6K * 4 months * 2 people = $48K\r\nStage 2: Launching teams\r\nSource and launch research teams and freelancing agencies onto the TFT Net\r\nWill need to do large scale marketing before hand to see interested parties\r\nCreate a Slack for managing the community.\r\nContinually gather feedback from teams and implement\r\n20 teams?\r\nPossibly create a channel per team\u00a0\r\nWould like to add a Marketer and a Community Manager to the team\r\nFunding Requested: ($8K * 4 months * 4 people) + $12k for infrastructure budget = $140K\r\nStage 3: Implementing business model\r\nDiscover the \"limited resources\" areas of the protocol and begin to build a pay-per-use business model around them\r\nReach out to possible universities, companies, and TFTs themselves for partnership deals\r\nBuild out integrations with Stripe (web2) and Wallets (web3) giving users flexibility to how to sustain the protocol\r\nWe can\u2019t assume a web3-only audience - we are bridging onto existing TFT apps\r\nWould like to add a Designer (for conversion flows) and second engineer (for maintaining existing product)\r\nFunding Requested: ($8K * 4 months * 6 people) + $18k for infrastructure budget = $210K\r\nStage 4: Growth\r\nPedal to the metal\r\nIncorporate work as a DAO\r\nWould like to add someone to just be in charge of documentation. Might need to add someone for legal\/flex spot.\r\nWould also like a budget for bounty work for non core contributors. Flex spot could be someone in charge of bounties from non core contributors.\r\nFunding Requested: ($8k * 4 months * 8 people) + $30k Infrastructure budget + $64k bounty budget (64 bounties at $1k) = $350K\r\n\r\nTeam Members + Relevant Experience\r\n\r\nDavid Vargas leads all engineering work on SamePage. David is the founder and maintainer of RoamJS - Roam's largest library of open source extensions. He has connections with team members at most of the tools for thought companies, and has built familiarity with the web3 space through work with Creator Cabins and Fission. He maintains constant contact with the team at Roam and has been influential in the design of their public APIs. He has been working as an independent open source software engineer for nearly two years now, after leaving a startup he worked at as an engineer the previous two years before that.\r\n\r\nBrendan Langen leads product and operations-related work on SamePage. Brendan has more than a decade of experience leading new product development and Product Design & Development teams at startups and established, growing companies. He's worked on popular educational games, business simulations, and award-winning authoring tools. Recently, Brendan worked with Robert Haisfield and Joel Chan to publish their research on scaling knowledge synthesis. This work dove deep into tools for thought and decentralized software, as funding came from Edge & Node. Through this, deep contacts have been established in the academic research and tools for thought communities that this tool is being built for.\r\n\r\nJoel Chan is an advisor to the SamePage project. Joel is an Assistant Professor in the University of Maryland\u2019s College of Information Studies (iSchool) and Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL). Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Project Scientist in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University, and received his PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. His research investigates systems that support creative knowledge work, such as scientific discovery and innovative design.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHis long-term goal is to help create a future where innovation systems are characterized by openness and sustainability. His research has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Institute for Museum and Library Sciences, Adobe Research, and Protocol Labs, and received Best Paper awards from the ASME Conference for Design Theory and Methodology, the Journal of Design Studies, and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). His most relevant recent and ongoing experience is the development and study of the Discourse Graph RoamJS extension, and supporting porting of these ideas to other tools like Logseq and Obsidian.\r\n\r\nOutreach!\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe see the SamePage Network as a gateway to enable the wider DeSci community. As a protocol layer, we want to give everyone the chance to use their own tools, so no silos exist in sharing knowledge. \r\n\r\nWe're friendly folks who always want to discuss the future of technology, so reach out if you want to make this a reality! \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBrendan + David",

		"description": "Introduction of Port3\r\nPort3 is the fastest growing Web3 gateway to Social Insights. Currently, it leverages a base of over 3.3 million users across Telegram, Twitter, and Discord with an average DAU of 11k. We are seeking to unlock the full potential of social data in the Web3 era.\r\n\r\nThere are three pillars to building the Port3 universe:\r\n\u2022 Social data aggregation channel: DAO tools that aggregate social data across Web2 & Web3 platforms, capture community sentiment & enable user acquisition & engagement;\r\n\u2022 SoGraph.xyz analysis platform: Visualized dashboard of key metrics, input\/output extrapolation for community profiling, and increased transparency of each user\/follower;\r\n\u2022 Port3 Data Layer: Open and collaborative on-chain data infrastructure for Web2 & Web3 platforms to integrate for utilization of fully customized social data\r\n\r\nWe are the first project to propose the Social Data Oracle, we aggregate social data from Web2 communities & social media and On-chain, analyze with a standard algorithm or nonstandard machine learning, then output to the dashboard for visualize read & API, SDK for APPs & DAPPs\r\n\r\nVarious use-cases: smart airdrops, soulbound NFTs mint, IDO whitelisting, DAO contribution verifications, etc. To achieve automation and transparency, we cover both Web2 & Web3 integrations, the accomplishment of the tasks, to finally output a standardized list. We have the answer to the final form of Web3 social data oracle and we will be the first to achieve it (accomplishment approx. 67%, deliver in early Q4 2022)\r\n\r\nWhat problem are we trying to solve?\r\nWe are trying to solve a contradiction that plagues the Web3 sector - data aggregation. More social data is needed to support smart airdrop, SoulBound, and other scenarios with the development of Web3. However there is no such data in Web3 and lots of social actions still happen in Web2, so we need to integrate the on-chain and off-chain data to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nWhat we are offering and how you are solving this problem?\r\nPort3 Network shares data by Social Data Oracle to meet the needs of the above scenarios. Specifically, we collect data from sorts of channels, and then clean, count, and analyze to get a result dataset, such as activeness index, campaign member lists, or community member lists. Finally, those data will be echoed to the Oracle Contract for the third-party DApps to read.\r\n\r\nAnd we have designed the architecture so that decentralized data aggregation and reading can be achieved, which can solve the problem of trustworthiness and availability of data.\r\n\r\nPort3 competitive advantage\r\nOur DAO Tool Bots have covered over 4,000 communities and owned more than 3.8 million users from crypto areas. These users are constantly generating data and can be converted into SoQuest participants. But our competitors may need to get into these communities in various ways and then accumulate users from scratch.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have rich experience in wallet development and on-chain data analysis, which can all guarantee that we are full of capacity to obtain comprehensive and sufficient data resources.\r\n\r\nWe expect to:\r\n1. Get Gitcoin Grants and support\r\n2. Gain exposure to projects and potential investment opportunities\r\n3. Get feedback and suggestions from Gitcoin\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "GoFanz app - First move-to-earn game for fans. A game based on blockchain, which connects healthy lifestyle, game and crypto. It turns users\u2019 steps into gaming rewards. It was established by a team of sports enthusiasts and professional gamers who have been looking for the best solution so that one can be physically active without turning exercise into fanatic passion.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEventually, GoFanz helps to make being healthy part of one\u2019s overall lifestyle naturally, as part of the game, and earn crypto currency. The platform combines 3 most popular models on the crypto market:\u00a0\r\n- Move-to-Earn;\r\n- Play-to-Earn;\r\n- Metaverse.\r\n\r\nHow it Works:\r\nEveryday activity recorded by a mobile or wearable device is converted into the game currency. 1000 steps = 1 GOZZ. GoFanz algorithms analyse steps recorded directly by your device and check them against other data points (GPS location, speed, and consistency of movement). It should be noted that the platform features a special anti-cheating system that prevents users from earning GOZZ in unfair ways.\r\n\r\nUsers can utilize their Avatars (Favarz) in daily battles to receive rewards of governance tokens, which later can be converted into fiat on crypto exchanges. Each Favarz is therefore unique and is essentially an NFT asset. A Favarz can be improved by 2 methods: \r\n1) Fans can receive daily rewards (GOZZ) for walking or jogging \u2013 the token can be spent to improve some characteristics of Avatar (Speed, Strength And Stamina).\r\n2) Fans can buy digital attributes in the form of NFT, which also boost the characteristics of Avatars. \r\n\r\nUpgrading Speed, Strength and Stamina boosts chances to win in Battles and get rewarded with GoFanz Tokens (GFZ). GFZ serves to:\r\n- Level up Favarz to keep upgrading;\r\n- Buy & sell items on marketplace;\r\n- Withdraw funds.\r\n\r\nGFZ is a fungible governance staking token is used to diversify users\u2019 experience in the GoFanz ecosystem and can be used in dApps, outside the GoFanz infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTaking all the above into account, GoFanz is set to be a potential game-changer among NFT-games and Metaverse development, impacting real lives and encouraging people to move more in a fun way. They are creating a unique model of a bridge between metaverse and the sports industry, allowing fans and athletes to communicate in the digital space.\r\n",

		"description": "Description\r\nBuilt by a distributed team, Sisu Network is an ambitious blockchain project in decentralized infrastructure to solve universal private transaction.\r\n\r\nTeam members\r\nMost of the members of Sisu want to remain anonymous with an exception of one founder who stay public for team verification. \r\nBilly Pham, Founder of Sisu Network\u00a0: Billy has experienced engineers with a wealth of knowledge in the Bay Area. Billy has 10+ years of experience and has worked for Google and several startups\r\nAn early engineer who was with Axie from the beginning.\r\nCryptography researcher :\u00a0He is experienced blockchain developer at Incognito, AstraProtocol. Thanh Nguyen is specialized in Confidential Transactions, Zero-Knowledge Proof.\r\nPrivacy advisor:\u00a0A Phd holder & post docs on blockchain privacy, including Zero-Knowledge Proof and Zk-snark.\r\nMBA, Founder of Token Play:\u00a0he is the Former Business Manager at OpenSea, and founder of Token Play. He now works as head of community building at Sisu.\r\nThey are both knowledgeable about blockchain consensus mechanisms and have contributed to various open source projects.\r\n\r\nManifesto\/Vision\r\nOur Vision is to help promote the widespread adoption of privacy through cross-chain interoperability. As survey, private transaction from both cross and in-chain, Tornado cash ($3B LVT), ZCash ($2B Cap) are privacy on a single chain. Sisu is\u00a0one of the first\u00a0solutions that enables universal private transaction\u00a0.\r\n\r\nWe believe that by enabling users to transfer assets across different blockchains, we can help\u00a0increase liquidity and value for users\u00a0.\u00a0Also, we vision that our proposal will help reduce congestion and costs associated with traditional methods of cross-chain interaction.\r\n\r\nProblem\r\nPrivate transaction is very hard to use and mostly used by criminals, as survey of Tornado Cash 2022.\r\n\r\nAs we know, privacy adoption is very much like Bitcoin adoption in early days and it would be hard to use: users often have to use external chains like Zcash, Monero. Especially, during these transaction, no privacy is ensured, including token swaps.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nSisu would like to make it simple by creating\u00a0universal private transactions\u00a0. It helps users easy to use by geting private transactions without leaving their chain. Once deposited, withdraw secretly anywhere and it could work on multiple chains.\r\n\r\nAlso, by\u00a0Threshold Signature Scheme\u00a0and\u00a0Zero Knowledge Proof\u00a0, transactions could be secured while keeping the tx fee cheap and while deleting all the trace of transaction source.\r\n\r\nGoals\r\nIf the project succeeds, it will achieve its mission of making the cross-chain interaction easier and simplify building cross-chain applications. It will also bring users and liquidity from other chains to your ecosystem.\r\n\r\nMetrics to Goal Measurement\r\nMetrics:\r\nNumber of users to use Sisu to swap token from any chain to Gitcoin\r\nTransaction volume cross chain\r\nVolume of private transaction on Gitcoin using Sisu\r\n\r\nSuccess will look like:\r\nBring 10,000 users to Gitcoin from all other blockchains\r\nTotal transaction volumes cross $25M\r\nTotal private transaction volume cross $5M\r\n\r\nProgress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have completed the Testnet Phase 1 with tokens swap on 5 different chains with test tokens. Next, we will launch Sisu on 10-15 chains with limited real token swaps. And, we will add private transaction for Sisu.\r\n\r\nDifferentiation\r\nCompetitors of Sisu are Thor Chain and ZCash:\r\nThor Chain: With estimated $1-3B market cap, Thor Chain only works on multiple chains only.\r\nZCash: With estimated $1-3B market cap, ZCash only supports privacy.\r\n\r\nHowever, with\u00a0the target $3-5B in 3 years\u00a0, Sisu Network is the only project that offers a secure multiple-chain transaction with threshold signature and universal private transaction (including NEAR, BTC, Cardano, etc).\r\nThis makes it stand out from the competition as it offers\u00a0more security and privacy\u00a0.\r\n\r\nGrant Request $\r\nPreseed: $35K-$50K each stage\r\nLooking to raise $600K for 3% max token supply in the Seed\r\n\r\nWhat the Funds Are For\r\nThe project will be maintained through the efforts of the development team hired with the grant funds. The team will continue to work on the project after completion of the grant to ensure that it remains operational and useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Overview\r\nWe are on a mission to revolutionize collaboration in science. The life sciences are existentially necessary and rapidly growing, but many labs struggle to build on existing work due to the incompatibility of their computational tooling. Ontologic is building a platform for researchers to easily share code and data, making their research output reusable, not just available.\r\n\r\nThe problem: a crisis in data and code management in science\r\nOver half of high-impact cancer lab studies cannot be replicated, and less than a quarter of published work is reproducible by drug companies. These issues arise in part from the challenges of collaborating while using incompatible analysis tools and data structures. Platform development infrastructure is usually unrelated to the core of a research lab's business, so life science companies that build software in-house often end up with code that is hard to reuse and data that is hard to replicate. This lack of usability is not only costly to the\r\ncompany, but is also harmful to the transparency and rigor of the research itself. \r\n\r\nOur solution: modern tooling for modern science\r\nOntologic's platform helps code writers and data collectors collaborate seamlessly on the cloud or compute cluster. It automates the process of packaging code into easily reusable analysis modules. The outputs are linked to machine-readable metadata structures, ready to share between users or publish on repositories. Using Ontologic's platform, users can compose analysis modules into custom pipelines and track the provenance of their inputs and outputs in a standard system. By abstracting away the particulars of data formats and programming languages, researchers can focus on the science, not the setup, of their data analysis.\r\n\r\nTeam and Progress\r\nOur founding team consists of 3 MIT-trained PhDs with expertise in molecular, systems, and computational neuroscience and an ex-Google software engineer with expertise in distributed computing. We are serving graduate students as pilot users with a prototype product. Three lab leaders at MIT and other institutions have signed letters of intent to engage with us on a per-seat subscription model in 2023. We plan to build our platform in the highly interdisciplinary field of neuroscience and anticipate that our solution will provide value to clinical researchers, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, our planned follow-on markets.",

We work so hard teaching, educating, and onboarding people everyday of the week. The ENS FNHH is where people can be themselves, kickback and relax. Everyone brings a drink of their choice and we escape to ENS Island where only good vibes exist around our Virtual Bar.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you are in spaces as much as I am, you will understand the true need to mentally unwind. So many look forward to these two hours every friday when they don\u2019t have to be so smart \ud83d\ude02.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI truly with the proper support, I can really enhance the community\u2019s virtual experience by doing giveaways.

		"description": "TLDR\r\nHelp us fund the development of an open source version of the Citizen Garden (featured in The Guardian) to reclaim the public space and create new commons in every street.\r\n\r\nWhy does it matter?\r\nIn the face of the climate emergency, community is immunity. We urgently need to reconnect with nature and with one another, in every street. Regens, unite.\r\n\r\nA Citizen Garden is an invitation to take care of nature together and create new relationships in your street. It\u2019s about bringing the solarpunk future closer to the present.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Story\r\nIt all started in February 2020, 2 weeks before the first lockdown. We moved to a place in Brussels that has a garage, but we don\u2019t have a car. Since nobody could park in front of it, we decided to turn this dead space into a community garden. We picked up some planks at the hardware store, put in some soil, and invited neighbors to plant what they wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the city turned to a standstill with the COVID, it was beautiful to see nature continue to grow. Kids of the streets came to water it and take care of it. It started new conversations, new connections.\r\n\r\n\r\nSadly, the city didn\u2019t like it as much. They sent the police to ask us to remove it but we refused. On June 17th, we woke up and the garden was gone. We put posters in the neighborhood: nature missing.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWe finally found it back: it was the city that took it away and put it in the waste disposal facility among broken washing machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later, dozens of neighbors came to support the garden. They brought new plants and flowers. A new Citizen Garden re-emerged\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 8th, a team of super trained and courageous neighbors came to free the Citizen Garden in a special operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Citizen Garden is still standing strong in front of our house and has been recently featured in The Guardian along with many other similar initiatives in the UK (showing the potential for turning this into an international movement, rooted locally but globally connected)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan\r\nWe want to create open source blueprints that anyone can copy, adapt and improve upon to create different citizen gardens.\r\n\r\nTo improve on the first design, we will add a place for a tool library and book library, to facilitate sharing in the street. We will also include a communication board to share announcements (things we learned building the Citizen Bike Garden).\r\n\r\nWe will build one to replace the existing Citizen Garden and organize workshops to invite citizens to build others. We will also make videos to walk people through the steps.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nWebsite with pressbook and photos\r\nTwitter account: @citizen_garden\r\nCitizen Bike Garden\r\nMore flowers, fewer cars: the rewilders turning parking spaces into parks, The Guardian, 22\/06\/2022\r\nStreet garden back, despite Schaerbeek\u2019s best efforts to get rid of it, The Bulletin, 9\/07\/2020",

From strategies based on stablecoins to Bitcoin and a comprehensive range of ERC-20 tokens, our platform has everything users need to secure higher returns on their crypto.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, we have made Collateralizer DAO as intuitive and easy to use as possible. To start earning, a user only needs to select a strategy and deposit the corresponding token.\r\n\r\nAll of our products are built first and foremost to benefit our community, which is why all of Collateralizer DAO\u2019s strategies earn rewards not only for end-users but for anyone that contributes to our platform.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, Collateralizers DAO requires a 15% performance fee on every strategy. The remaining 85% is distributed to the users, compounding automatically in their chosen strategy\u2019s underlying asset. As an additional revenue stream for our community, Collateralizer DAO administers a 0.5% withdrawal fee when users remove their assets from a given strategy and distributes all proceeds back to veCDT holders.\r\n\r\nThere are much more details about our project. Due to the limited space, please refer to our website(https:\/\/www.collateralizer.xyz\/) to find out more information.\r\n\r\nPicture",

		"description": "The Eye is open! I will create a psychedelic tapestry with neon and bright wool to celebrate this powerful artefact entering the Lootverse!\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to hand-embroider a colourful, psychedelic tapestry, inspired by the recent announcement of The Eye \u2013 a magical artefact containing Loot stories, lore and legends. This second panel of The Loot tapestry will be a shamanic vision scene, inspired by the recent announcement of The Eye \u2013 a magical artefact containing Loot stories, lore and legends. I intend to embroider a mysterious, dream-like sequence depicting visions and legends being visualised through The Eye by a shaman, using neon and brite shades of wool and drawing inspiration from the brilliant Loot stories of the OpenQuill project!\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nI am a textile and fibre artist who is currently creating stories for the OpenQuill Project, and hand-sewing The Loot tapestry. I specialise in historical recreations and restorations of Aztec artworks and codexes, in particular the Codex Borgia and the Codex Laud.\r\n\r\n\u00a0About:\r\nNot familiar with the Lootverse?\r\nThe Lootverse is an ecosystem of interconnected sci-fantasy stories, games, art & multimedia. Learn more here!\r\n\r\nThe Proposal:\r\nMy proposal is to create a second embroidered panel for The Loot Tapestry. This sequence would depict The Eye being used by a shaman to visualise scenes from Loot lore and legend, as outlined in stories from the Openquill programme.\r\n\r\nFor this dream-like, psychedelic vision sequence I intend to use black calico, and brightly coloured and neon-tone wools outside of the standard \u201cCodex Borgia\u201d colour palette. For this piece if enough funding is received I will source my wool ethically from organically kept British sheep, and will pay a craftswoman to traditionally hand-dye the wool for me according to my needs and colour specifications. \r\n\r\nInterest and publicity for Loot will be generated through regular work in progress posts on social media. The final physical piece could be sold or auctioned, with the majority of profits going back into the Loot DAO to help fund future artistic works and projects.\r\n\r\nOne of the principle inspirations for this project is the Bayeux tapestry, an 11th century embroidered tapestry that tells the sequential story of the Norman conquest of England.\r\n\r\nThe art style is strongly inspired by the Aztec Codex Borgia, and in particular I will be relying on hallucinogenic vision sequences from the codexes to guide my artwork style. Some examples of my Codex restoration artworks using neon and bright colours are below:\r\n\r\n\r\nPricing:\r\n$300 (minimum required): A small (approx. 20x20cm) embroidery of The Eye (1 month completion time)\r\n$500+: A medium (approx. 30x30cm) bordered embroidery of The Eye (1.5 month completion time)\r\n$1500+: A medium (approx. 30x30cm) bordered embroidery of a shamanic vision sequence (3 months completion time)\r\n$3500+: A large (approx. 50x50cm) bordered embroidery of a shamanic vision sequence, using hand-dyed ethically sourced wool (5 month completion time)\r\n$5500+: A large (approx 100x50cm) bordered embroidery of a shamanic vision sequence, using hand-dyed ethically sourced wool (8 month completion time)\r\n$8000 ( Maximum amount required): A larger and more complex bordered scene depicting a shamanic vision sequence, using hand-dyed ethically sourced wool and depicting a number of characters and visions (10 month completion time). Approx size 150x100cm\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf this bid is successful then future tapestry panels could be created and commissioned in future grant funding rounds.",

We have partnered up with a local carbon footprint consultancy firm for using their carbon footprint calculator, which will also allow us access to their clients. We also have an agreement with one provider in Gokceada (biggest island of Turkey). We will do our PoC in Gokceada, by creating the application documents & acquiring carbon credits through Verra. We will use a drone to capture images for both submitting to Verra & using for the project NFTs.

It has been absolutely amazing to see everyone go through an unfunded program. Now we\u2019ve hit a tipping point where we need funding to scale our program by hiring additional mentors, more instructors, and to begin providing stipends for students.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Minority Programmers cohort program is a 3-month intensive program that occurs year-round, and recruits on a rolling basis, Students across the world are given hands-on experience working with corporate teams (15-20 hours weekly). Implementing Agile SCRUM methodologies, students use the leading project management tool ClickUp, have tri-weekly daily standups, bi-monthly sprint review, retrospective, and backlog grooming sessions with 24\/7 support from mentors and other developers.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPiloted in February 2021, over 100 bright students have successfully graduated from the program with a plethora of relevant deliverables under their resumes. The cohort is highly competitive, implementing a skills test during the admissions process, equivalent to a final project in industry.\u00a0 At the beginning of the onboarding process, students are taught agile scrum methodologies, get acquainted with the latest technologies like Github, Figma, VsCode, ClickUp, Discord, Signal, ReactJS, Solidity, custom MPA email, etc. students are assigned to complete a 3-month roadmap and SMART goal for the program after which the hiring team evaluates (with consideration to the behavioral interview and where the student wants to be in their long term career) to best place the student in teams and project tasks that give the most exposure to what that student wants to learn. Throughout the program, every student meets with Shot, the President of MPA, to check in on their well-being and to steer the direction of their studies for the next scrum based on what they want to learn. As part of the Sprint Reviews students are expected to present their work for the past sprint in a professional manner, but also to produce video deliverables for those working asynchronously.\u00a0 As part of the graduation process students are given a custom certificate (to be minted as NFT), a program outcomes review by their supervisor, complete an in-depth exit survey and a reflection worksheet that allows them to easily translate their experience at MPA into resume items. At the end of the program, every student will have successfully worked on large projects (mostly software) with an international team communicating & collaborating when necessary with a handful of deliverables that they can showcase to employers. Shot the President of MPA, a JMU CS\/CIS Alumni has even said, \u201cIf I were in college doing my program, I would not be able to perform on the level my students do today\u201d. He has said that \u201cOur students not only get tasks done in a timely fashion, but even self organize and share ideas that improve the culture of the entire organization.\u201d MPA is not just a cohort but an opportunity to build a lifelong professional network; they can continue to be involved in whatever capacity with the focus of giving minorities the opportunity to become leaders in the STEM industry.\u201d. A CS graduate, Shot has designed this program to give all positions (even non-stem ones) exposure to the STEM field, with relevant tech stacks that are used in modern industries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nTracks\r\nThe following is a list of tracks as part of Minority Programmers Association Cohort Program\r\n\u00a0\r\nSoftware Engineer - ReactJs\r\nSoftware Engineer - MERN\r\nFront End Developer\r\nUI\/UX Designer\r\nGraphic Designer\r\nWeb Developer\r\nSoftware QA Engineer\r\nProject Manager\r\nBlockchain Engineer\r\nCryptocurrency\/Blockchain R&D\r\nData Science\r\nInvestment Analyst\r\nGrant Researcher\r\nHuman Resources\r\nBusiness Development\r\nDigital Marketing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimonials\r\n\r\n\r\nMPA Background\r\nMinority Programmers Association provides all stages of development from idea to MVP, to actively providing development support.

		"description": "Cashmere is an omnichain-based project that adds layers to these technologies and optimizes capital efficiency in addition to decreasing associated risks by letting users be able to swap any single-sided assets between any chain without bridging.\r\nWhile maintaining omnichain swap, which allows for asset exchanges between 7 different chains due to interoperability cross-chain messaging protocol.\r\n\r\nCashmere is a unique application that has both a stableswap and an asset aggregator in one application at the same time.\r\nStableswap uses Cashmere's own liquidity directly and becomes a Layer2 solution.\r\nOn the other hand, the aggregator uses all liquidity pools in any network and offers the lowest slippage to the user.\r\n\r\nHow is that possible?\r\nWell, in Cashmere, assets to be traded on the source chain use the aggregator to find the best offer on the source chain, asset swaps to stablecoin, and stablecoin is locked on the source chain by Cashmere. With its own liquidity pools and interoperability messaging protocol, Cashmere allows users in the target chain to withdraw equal stablecoin from pools. The user performs the swap and gets its presence on the target chain.\r\n\r\nThis way makes the swapped asset MEV Resistant because it is performed using only cross-chain messaging without sending a cross-chain swap transaction.",

		"description": "BlockGurus aims to address a disconnect between the potential utility of smart contract blockchains to real estate, and the actual lack of market penetration of such technology.\r\n\r\nReal Estate is a perfect business vertical to embrace web3 and blockchain technology,  especially smart contract technology. Yet after a decade of hearing how this would happen, the inroads are still quite unimpressive. This is because the target audience has not, until now, had a practical way to get familiar with the possibilities.\r\n\r\nReal Estate is a fractured marketplace, with unnecessary hurdles to normalized data and a genuine consumer centric experience. We believe that this means that the 'killer app' that onboards this vertical needs to be something that is at once:\r\n\r\nsimple\r\nfamiliar\r\naffordable\r\nactionable\r\nunobtrusive\r\n\r\nWe believe, based on practical experience, that ENS is that onramp. Real estate was a singularly large consumer of web2 domains\/hosting - it is a marketing technique that agents are quite familiar with. They already like to brand themselves and their brokerage with names - ENS is a natural transition. It is simple, familiar, affordable, actionable and benign to existing models.\r\n\r\nIn turn, on the other side of the real estate experience, consumers lack access to a reliable, transparent source of information. Realtors for their part have no decentralized, viable resource to express their genuine, verifiable value proposition.\r\n\r\nBlockGurus efforts attempt to resolve this inefficiency by pioneering an industry specific Ethereum Identity Space, for real estate. We hope to provide REALTOR\u00ae associations with a free public good in the form of the web3 infrastructure to:\r\n\r\nTeach them to claim a web3 identity in the form of their 8 digit License ID (this may prove harder than we anticipated given the popularity of digits!)\r\nProvide them with 'tokens of their trade' essentially - in the form of POAP tokens\r\n\r\n\r\nBlockGurus acts as plumbing, providing a translation layer for the 1100 local REALTOR\u00ae Associations in the US to Oracle their data into web3.\r\n\r\nWe provide Association staff the data\/utility to tokenize the following:\r\n\r\nENS name registration\r\nENS subdomain management\r\nLicensed REALTOR\u00ae status\r\nCertifications & Designations\r\nAnnual Election \u2018I Voted\u2019\r\nCommittee & Board Service\r\nAnnual Charitable Contributions\r\n\r\nSince we aim to provide this utility as a free public good we are looking to identify grant funding. As referenced, we are nearing an MVP, and have a tentative MOU for Business Development Operations with the 4,000 member Contra Costa Association of REALTORS\u00ae, and are in discussions with the Northern San Diego Association as well.\r\n\r\nOn the technology side, we have worked closely with several key staff at POAP, and await the subcontract update from ENS. For more nuance and texture on what we are trying to do, we strongly encourage you to listen to some of our onboarding podcasts.\r\n\r\nAn example of one of our first POAP\r\n\r\n\r\nCCAR's incoming Board President xyz profile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA glimpse at our portal staged in development\r\n\r\nWith the benefit of the updated subwrapper contract options, our ultimate goal is to tokenize real property parcels as well as instances of MLS properties\/listings using ENS and subdomains, such that every property, and every listing of that property, is wrapped as an ENS asset. At this point, attribution for these assets accrue to the agents involved, and become their 'proof of work' if you will, where their ENS name is the key reference.\r\n\r\nWe engineered a web analog of this in a sense, with a few members of our team way back in 2008 on a service called streeturls - where we subdomain every property and present it as a single property webpage - sorry for the very dated appearance, we haven't updated it since 2010... but you can see:\r\n\r\na community index here:http:\/\/danville.ca.streeturls.com\/\r\na single property http:\/\/3332.green_meadow_dr.danville.ca.streeturls.com\/\r\nan agents sales history buy\/sell side https:\/\/streeturls.com\/agents\/206525972\/history\r\n\r\nThe idea here is obviously to do something conceptually similar to this with ENS. The resulting identity space would have many potential efficiencies over existing models, as well as the clear basis to create many more.\r\n\r\nWe believe our application, at this time at least, is best categorized as addressing these two of the presented goal set:\r\n\r\nUsability - improving the user experience\r\nCommunity - growing the ecosystem\r\n\r\nWe are happy to provide additional information as needed, and appreciate your consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "The 'ERC-Cool' is an improved implementation on the Ethereum standard smart contract ERC721A, that uniquely weaves real world perpetual carbon capture to any NFT use case that adopts it. It is an open source - planet cooling - super sustainable - delight. A digital public good intended to be adopted and sprinkled to every corner of the internet. \r\n\r\nWhile the impact happens out there, the carbon that is removed stacks up inside the NFT, to create an additional layer of value that grows with each and every trade, to for the first time create climate action for the ownership era. \r\n\r\nThis is impact that, once started, cannot be stopped. Immutable and perpetual. These are NFT's embedded with carbon removal to create a scalable, collective, powerful tool to combat climate change.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgrammed to cool.\r\nInspired by the likes of the Curious Addys, MetaAngels and the Azuki Community with their ERC721A innovation, we wanted to push the space further and improve on the standard iteration - to not only allow the crypto community to solve pain points but also solve the greatest challenge of our time and collectively fight climate change with each and every NFT. \r\n\r\nThe ERC-Cool smart contract features functions that purchase carbon removals at the prevailing market rate, then add that carbon back to the NFT. The result is, NFTs laced with real world carbon removal and an additional layer of value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiving carbon removal a bold assist.\r\nThe Earth\u2019s biosphere, unaided, cannot fix the climate problem. In other words, nature was never designed to cope with a 170-year all-you-can-eat oil & gas buffet. \r\n\r\nFocussing on reducing emissions is no longer enough, we must simultaneously work to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere - and do so as permanently as possible. This is no longer a last resort, it's an urgent necessity. \r\n\r\nIf humanity is to survive the climate emergency we have to scale the carbon removal from todays tons, to gigaton scale within the next decade. Scientists estimate we need to permanently remove as much as 6 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2030, and 10 gigatons per year by 2050... yet in 2021, we removed just 10,000 tons. \r\n\r\nCarbon removal requires a bold assist. We need to scale radical tech innovation - beyond reducing carbon emissions, beyond the solutions we already have in our toolkit to increase the likelihood the world has the portfolio of solutions it needs to tackle the task at hand. \r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nWe have to figure out how to hit Ctrl+Z on decades worth of carbon pollution - ASAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for some good news.\r\nMuch of the technologies we need to tackle this has already begun to be developed. They're just early, more expensive and therefore underfunded and underutilized. Unless we step in, these solutions will be left on the shelf. instead of playing a critical part of the solution. The ERC-Cool will direct funds to accelerate carbon removal in order to cool the planet now and into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow we're getting it done:\r\nSTEP ONE - The ERC-Cool contains withdraw and royalties functions, that auto-trigger the purchase of high quality Carbon Removal credits upon minting or transaction. In partnership with Patch it will direct critical funds to removals technologies in order to create demand and grow future supply, and provide the world a better chance having the portfolio of solutions we require. \r\n\r\nSTEP TWO - The Carbon Removal credits are then bridged on chain and locked into our carbon pool. This is a one-way bridge: carbon credits can be brought on-chain but can't go the other way. The reason for that is simple: to prevent double-counting and lock them away for permanent impact. \r\n\r\nSTEP THREE - We then tokenize and fractionalize the carbon removal credits via our $CXXL token. A carbon reference token backed by real world carbon removal, where 1 $CXXL = 1 KG of carbon removed.\r\n\r\nSTEP FOUR - Finally we embed the amount of $CXXL generated back into the initiating NFT via dynamic metadata. The more ERC-Cool NFTs are sold and traded - the more carbon removed. With each transaction increasing the fundamental value of the NFT itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooling the planet isn't a spectator sport.\r\nTo tackle climate change, we need mass coordination and action at scale. We need everyone to take every opportunity  possible to make an impact. We are the ones we've been waiting for. With the innovations in Web3 that radically reducing barriers to coordination between individuals and groups, decentralizing influence, authority and productivity in unprecedented ways, we can finally take action into our own hands. The ERC-Cool is a tool for collective action, able to scale to something bigger than any individual action. \r\n\r\nIf adopted as the new standard, the ERC-Cool will unlock a scale of action never seen before, out-funding the carbon removal efforts of the likes Stripe, Shopify, Alphabet, Meta, McKinsey and Elon (X-Prize) - put together. This is action for the people, by the people. So let's cool this mighty fine planet together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll roads lead to cool.\r\nThe ERC-Cool is currently in the R&D phase of development. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate being able to release the standard in October with The world's first 'mint of intent'. Like a letter of intent in web2, but cooler. This is a free mint, a collective proof of concept and social signal of intent to do web3 differently.\r\n\r\nThen to see the year out and with money in the company slush fund from the fine folk at the Solana Foundation, we will move to cool those on the Sol train and onboard web2 in partnership with Shopify. \r\n\r\nAnd that's just for starters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProudly developed by\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Gitcoin GR15?\r\nThe main aim is to delight you and make you aware of the open source coolness we're cooking up over convincing you to open your wallet. But in GR15 your wallet goes a long way too. If you generously support, your funding will assist in: \r\n\r\n\ud83c\udd92 ERC-Cool Completion\r\n\ud83c\udd92 Drop the Mint of Intent (like a web2 letter of intent but... you get the idea)\r\n\ud83c\udd92 Marketing and building awareness\r\n\r\nStay cool \u270c\ufe0f\r\n\r\n\r\nMore info\r\nhttps:\/\/trescoollabs.xyz\/ \r\nhttps:\/\/erc-cool.org\/\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/TresCoolLabs\r\n\r\n\r\nGet in touch\r\nWant to collab or adopt the contract?

		"description": "Pretty Good Crypto provides enterprise-level e-mail encryption and anti-phishing protection through crypto technology to every user.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is normal and everywhere in 2022. Signal, FaceTime and iMessage\u00a0are end-to-end encrypted, https encrypts website traffic, and Zcash encrypts crypto transactions.\r\n\r\nHowever, E-mail is still sent unencrypted.\u00a0It is stored unencrypted on your device and mail servers.\r\n\r\nThere are existing solutions like PGP, but they are hard to use. Even the PGP inventor himself doesn\u2019t use it anymore. That\u2019s why we created OpenPGC: Open Pretty Good Crypto.\r\n\r\nOpenPGC is a new blockchain-agnostic standard that uses existing crypto keys to encrypt and sign e-mail. The signing and encrypting happens off-chain, so there are no gas fees for sending OpenPCG-encrypted e-mail.\r\n\r\nThe user is in control. OpenPGC is non-custodial and uses existing self-sovereign identity protocols to link keys with identities. For example, you can send e-mails to ENS domains:\r\n\r\n\r\nOpenness is OpenPGC\u2019s strength. This not only enables the users to choose the blockchain(s) or identity protocol(s) they prefer, it also allows OpenPGC to continuously improve as blockchains and identity protocols evolve. This process is nearly impossible with fixed siloed standards such as PGP.\r\n\r\nStop phishing attacks\r\nA major result of using OpenPGC would be a great reduction in phishing attacks. If all e-mails were signed with our Ethereum keys, phishing would be a lot harder.\r\n\r\nDemo available\r\nWe have created a technical demo called Moonfish that demonstrates how unobtrusive a crypto-based privacy solution can be. Users can continue to use their existing e-mail addresses, existing e-mail servers and existing e-mail client. It's so easy, it's hard to believe it's crypto. Contact us for a TestFlight invite (macOS-only for now).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's next?\r\nThe current OpenPGC implementation intentionally follows existing standards as closely as possible, such as RFC-4880 (openPGP), EIP-1024 (Cross-client Encrypt\/Decrypt) and EIP 712 (Typed structured data hashing and signing). However, the current standardizations efforts are falling short and are unable to support where the ecosystem is moving. Therefore, OpenPGC is leading an effort to standardize safer and more versatile encryption and signing of messages and files. This grant enables us to improve OpenPGC and work together with cryptographers and wallet developers to create an important blockchain-agnostic privacy standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeliverables\r\nWith this grant, we aim to create the following deliverables:\r\nA space to discuss how to improve and secure the old EIP proposals and how to make the new standard blockchain agnostic.\r\nA new specs document\r\nAn open source JS implementation of OpenPGC, possibly a browser extension. Aimed to be as easy to integrate in existing wallets as possible\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Hi zkFrens, We\u2019re thrilled to join the GR15 and bring zkPass to you! Please read our Technical Whitepaper\u00a0or the References\u00a0to know more about us. Some brief content will be shown here, TL;DR.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is zkPass\r\nzkPass is a decentralized KYC solution based on MPC (Multi-Party Computation) and ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof), which aims to overcome the various flaws in the current KYC system, eliminate the pain points related to identity authentication, and protect user privacy while expanding KYC capabilities.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKey Features\r\nGenerality:\u00a0Individual users can generate and reuse their identity multiple times, and their information will not be leaked to any third party throughout the multi-party interaction.\r\nCustomization:\u00a0Enterprise users can select and configure KYC templates on demand to meet KYC needs in different dimensions, while the verifying party knows nothing about the data.\r\nPrivacy-preserving:\u00a0Strong data privacy-preserving is achieved through MPC (interaction session) and ZKP (proof session), while the parties to the agreement have no knowledge of the data.\r\nCompatibility:\u00a0zkPass protocol is backward compatible and widely adapted to the current data source protocol, while the data source has no knowledge of the data destination.\r\nDecentralization:\u00a0The zkPass protocol is completely decentralized as there is no centralized service to store sensitive user data.\r\n\u00a0\r\nzkPass\u2019 Solutions\r\nzkPass Protocol:\u00a0A decentralized open source protocol consisting of Transport Layer Security, Multi-Party Computation, Zero Knowledge Proof and other technologies. It is run by zkPass Node to build a decentralized Verifier that participates in the three-party TLS protocol.\r\nzkPass Kit: Build a Prover for the three-party TLS protocol on top of the TCP layer alongside the Https layer, in the form of a plugin\/SDK. Business users select or customize a suitable KYC template according to their needs, configure the template into zkPass Kit in the form of parameters, and initiate KYC requests to the smart contract on blockchain.\r\nSmart Contract: 1)Template: Store templates and related parameters to prevent Verifier from cheating.2)Task: Assign tasks to specify MPC participants to prevent Verifier from conspiring.3)ZK Verification: verify ZKP to prevent user privacy leakage.\r\n\u00a0\r\nzkPass Protocol\r\n\r\nTechnical One-Page\r\n\r\nRelated Technologies\r\nTLS: Transport Layer Security, which is a protocol used to provide confidentiality and data integrity between two communicating applications. TLS is the cornerstone of communication in the web world.\r\nMPC: Multi-Party Computation, which allows multiple participants to jointly participate in the computation without revealing their privacies. It mainly uses Garbled Circuits and Oblivious Transfer algorithms.\r\nZKP:\u00a0Zero Knowledge Proof,\u00a0which refers to the ability of a prover to convince a verifier that an assertion is correct without providing any useful information to the verifier. Its specific implementation will be based on the PLONK algorithm.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThree Stages\r\nThree-party Handshake\r\nData Query\r\nZero-knowledge Proof\r\n\r\nThe overall system architecture of zkPass is shown in the following figure.\r\n\r\nThe overall system includes the following components:\r\nzkPass Kit\r\nTheGraph\r\nzkPass Backend\r\nSmart Contract\r\nNode Cluster\r\nWeb2 Issuers",

Every society, large or small, must devise ways in which its members will share this gift.\"\r\n- Robert Swann, Schumacher Center for New Economics\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe commodification and privatization of land support debt cycles that promote extractive and unsustainable practices.\r\n\r\nAt ReCommon Foundation, we facilitate the reclamation and stewardship of common land by supporting resilient place-based economies and regenerative cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new credit methodology for the commons\r\n\r\nWe propose to use grant funds to create an interdisciplinary working group to research and develop a methodology for a \u201cCommons Credit,\u201d a new credit class within the larger stack of ReFi credit classes. This working group will be organized and sponsored by ReCommon Foundation (previously Regenerative Community Land Trust) with input from partner organizations such as Basin DAO and Center for CLT Innovation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce developed and launched, this Commons Credit will quantify and allow for the sale of the certified impact created by the de-privatization of land - i.e. the purchasing of a piece of property or Real World Asset (RWA), removing it from the speculative market, and bringing it into the commons for perpetual ownership and stewardship by the community. The working group\u2019s research would explore what would qualify as a \u201ccommons,\u201d what the economic, environmental, and social impacts of bringing land into the commons are, and what is the best methodology for quantifying and valuing the sum of these impacts in a way that empowers local land stewards and also creates trust and transparency for impact investors.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology research and development\r\n\r\nThis research would have three phases:\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first phase would be an evaluation of the relevant literature and work that has been done in quantifying the impact of bringing lands into the commons and commons management. This phase would look at the environmental, social, and economic impacts of removing land from private ownership models and returning them into the commons, and the various ownership structures that could qualify as \u201ccommons.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe second phase of research would be the development of a proposed methodology of what would qualify a land-based project for a commons credit, with specific exploration of how Elinor Ostram\u2019s 8 principles for managing a commons can be deployed for the ensuring success of the Commons Credit system. It would look at real-world examples of \u201ccommons creation\u201d and examine the challenges and successes of these examples to inform the methodology.\r\n\r\nThe third phase of research would be the publication of a report and a proposed methodology for the Commons Credit system. We would put this report out to the larger ReFi community, environmental stewardship and conservation groups around the globe and ask for feedback based on their experience. This feedback process would allow a \u201cground truthing\u201d to occur- ensuring that the proposed methodology is grounded in the real-world context and challenges that community-stewarded land projects face.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding a community around commons preservation\r\n\r\nThroughout our research process, we will hold weekly Twitter spaces to allow the greater ReFi communities to benefit from our learnings. This type of learning in public also allows for questions and insights to be gathered from the larger ReFi ecosystem, and creates a dialectic relationship between community-wide learning and knowledge production. This would benefit both the larger ReFi community and the quality of the final report and proposed methodology. On these Twitter spaces, we may host certain influential thinkers\/academics whom we are learning from in that phase of our research.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis working group will include the following researchers:\r\n-Charlie Fisher: Center for Community Land Trust Innovation and PhD student at the Oxford Brookes Program studying the intersection of the commons and web 3.\u00a0\r\n-Anna-Marie Swan: Team member at Regens Unite and Nestr, and ReCommon DAO contributor who brings expertise in collaborative governance structures and the commons.\u00a0\r\n-Thomas Morgan (TMO) will be acting as a strategic advisor to the working group. BasinDAO founder, working on RWA founders circle and RWA Report for Climate Collective, as well as the BasinDAO eco-credit methodology.\r\n-Sebastian Rodriguez-Larrain: Impact-Driven Photographer, Celo Foundation Ambassador, and President of Regenera Peru.\r\n-Colleen Cummings: PhD at University of Denver student studying transformative and regenerative practices, community organizing, and collective action.\r\n-Charlie Dubbe: Executive director of ReCommon, 10 years of experience in regenerative agriculture. Studied the impact of the commons and patterns of privatization at UC Berkeley School of Geography.\u00a0\r\n-Alex Corren: Co-founder and Board President of ReCommon. His background is in environmental science, focusing on water resources and regenerative systems design.\r\n-Chris Giersch: Chief of Operations at ReCommon. Chris has a background in coding and development and is the organizational backbone of the foundation.\u00a0\r\n-Matthew Lawley: Director of Marketing and Communications at ReCommon. Outside of his work with ReCommon, Matt is  a skilled permaculture designer and farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccelerating climate impact from the ground up\r\n\r\nThe creation of a Commons Credit methodology has the potential for significant impact in accelerating climate action. This Commons Credit will act as an economic engine for on-the-ground communities that are engaging in regenerative land stewardship practices on communally owned lands. One can trace the roots of much of the land degradation and extraction of natural resources that are fueling climate change back to land privatization and speculation. To hold land as a commons in a perpetual stewardship entity such as a Regenerative Community Land Trust ensures that the land will be preserved and stewarded regeneratively for generations to come.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Commons Credit will grow to be a key layer in the ReFi economic engine that pays communities for their regenerative stewardship practices, activating the grass-roots, community-led fight against climate change.\r\n\r\nOver 80% of the world's biodiversity is held within lands stewarded by indigenous groups and organizations, with most of them practicing some sort of communal land ownership. That means that the majority of the world's biodiversity - including genetic diversity, plant, animal, fungal diversity, etc. - relies on the success of the commons and its regenerative management. Developing a Commons Credit protocol to financially empower the stewards of communally held lands can play a critical role in the preservation and protection of this biodiversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture assurance for the carbon and eco-credits\r\n\r\nThe Commons Credit acts as an \u2018assurance layer\u2019 to projects that are producing carbon credits, eco-credits, and other impact certificates. The \u2018assurance\u2019 is that the projects receiving climate impact funding cannot simply be abandoned and sold for private gain after a few years, because they take place on community-owned lands, held in trust. In turn, this strengthens the claim of any climate project that the impact they are making is, indeed, long-term and for the benefit of the community.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Commons Credit has the unique function of an impact assurance layer, ensuring that land-based impact funded by carbon credits (and other eco-credits) is preserved in perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\"The care of the Earth is our most ancient and most worthy, and after all - our most pleasing responsibility.\"\r\n-Wendell Berry\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAbout ReCommon Foundation\r\n\r\nAt ReCommon, we see that our current civilization and paradigm are on the way out.

It lets any developer give any internet connected machine complete awareness of real life environments regardless of economic, geographic or political barriers. It democratizes surveillance and artificial intelligence by putting it back into the hands of everyday people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn API for Apps & Smart Contracts\r\nThe P2P network's censorship-resistant and permissionless API lets 3rd-party applications and smart contracts query, locate, and respond immediately to physical changes in any tangible asset around the world. The entire blockchain is free for anyone to access. \r\n\r\nDecentralised Autonomous Intelligence\r\nEach computer vision software client forms part of a decentralised autonomous intelligence that incentivizes its expansion across the globe by paying miners to reveal all the \"dark\" areas on its map of the world. No one owns or controls the network and anyone can take part.\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Data of the Physical World\r\nGrassland's blockchain is a live, digital twin of the real world that anyone can access. In addition to regular wallet address, its blockchain has binary coordinate addresses that are long enough to encode every object-event within 7.5 billion KM* over the next 400 years. It's computer vision can process video streams from optical or thermal cameras, whether they're terrestrial or satellite cams. Which means that researchers can get analytical data about both the past and present states of the physical world and human interactions, including the spread of diseases, as well as real-time information on even the tiniest environmental changes taking place anywhere this decentralized AI's awareness has expanded to. \r\n\r\n\r\nA New Geospatial Blockchain: Creating a Tamper-Resistant History of the Physical World\r\n  - The AI regulates and bankrolls its own expansion to produce a tamper-resistant history of the physical world that anyone can freely access \r\n\u00a0\u00a0- Its binary addresses are long enough to encode every object-event within 7.5 billion KM* over its 400 year block reward schedule\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- Captures basic 3D features to prioritize real-time intelligence over photorealism (compression ratio of >2000:1 over the original video)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Clients are \"localized\"; computation and compression always scales with the network's size\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- Teaches itself the correct relationships between object-events\u00a0regardless of human intervention \r\n\r\nTrustless Intelligence Gathering\r\nIt'll always work the way it's supposed to whether or not the participants (individuals, companies, governments, etc.) trust or even know each other. Like the internet, no one owns or controls it. Anyone can participate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlock Reward\r\nThe AI compensates miners for their computer vision. There's no token (or NFT). It's the Grassland blockchain's native coin. It has to be because computer vision requires computation, hence you can't get away from PoW. And Grassland's PoW is specifically designed for AI's. This PoW is also eco-friendly since it doesn't need arbitrary hashing. It lets the network thwart spam and DDoS attacks so it can provide valid, life saving intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe block reward itself is split up among all the miners. They each get a piece of the \"pie\". And only 21 million coins will ever be mined.\r\n\r\nUpcoming Feature\r\nRegion Bounties is a native smart contract that will make it easy for everyone to get real-time digital twins of the parts of the world that they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n* 7.5 billion KM is the range of the Kuiper asteroid belt at the edge of the solar system\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We will accumulate the learnings in a GitBook and share them with the grant supporters. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\nCoffee Carbon Collective (CCC) is a project born in May 2022 during ReFi DAO hackathon. CCC creates a solution to provide pre-financing to coffee farmers and transition to generative agriculture.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nRising temperatures are going to reduce the area suitable for growing coffee by up to 50% by 2050.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee farmers suffer from climate change affecting their farmers and recognize the urge to transition to agroforestry to protect their farms and future. You can read more about agroforestry here.\r\nDuring the last months, we spoke to more than 50 farmers in Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Brazil. We also did 25 face-to-face interviews at World of Coffee (the largest coffee industry event, June 2022) and talked to 20 coffee, regenerative agriculture, and carbon project development professionals:\r\n100% of coffee farmers suffer from climate change already now (drought, shifting seasons, pests & diseases).\r\n93% of interviewed coffee farmers recognize the need to transition to regenerative agriculture and consider agroforestry the only viable solutions\r\nTransition to agroforestry takes 4-5 years and requires financial and human resources. Crop volume drops short-term, and farmers need to have the security of revenues.\r\nRight now smallholder farmers (3-5 ha) are not able to get certified to sell carbon credits (certification cost 50k and is financially feasible for 1000ha farms).\r\nSmallholders are ready to act, but the absence of pre-financing tools and safety nets stops them from switching to regenerative agriculture and sequestering carbon at their farms already now!\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nCCC provides a web3 AI-enabled ecosystem to support coffee farmers in transitioning to agroforestry by providing tools for pre-financing and tools for direct trade with climate-conscious coffee buyers.\r\nFarmer enrolls into agroforestry transition program with CCC, CCC quantifies future carbon savings and mints a geo-spatial NFT that keeps the track of regeneration of the farm. Farmer requests pre-financing of transition by issuing carbon credit tokens that are connected to geospatial NFTs using CCC infrastructure and fundraising directly from the climate-conscious buyers. CCC guides the farmer through transition and keeps the track of activities, verifies practices and results through dMRV. CCC provides another set of contracts for the direct coffee trade to open market access for \"regenerated coffee\".\r\nWe believe that there is a great opportunity to build a solution for insetting, not offsetting. There is a strong commitment of traders and roasters to reducing the carbon footprint of coffee production and a strong will to support the farmers they work with. However, like any carbon credit buyer, they need transparency and accountability. We are developing our solution on Celo and Filecoin, using a dMRV infrastructure like dMeter or MRV Collective.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nThere are 10.2 million ha of coffee land worldwide, 84% of coffee is grown under sun in mono-crop farms and only 16% on average - shade or agroforestry grown. You can read about the impact of agroforestry systems here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon sequestration potential (carbon stock) for agroforestry-grown coffee is 6.5 tons\/ha in comparison to 2.6 tons\/ha with conventional production. Check out more here. At the moment coffee producing areas sequester 32,508,898.50 tons of carbon, but switching to agroforestry has the potential to sequester 34,204,306.50 tons more! Check out calculations here.\r\nBesides, switching to agroforestry will mean:\r\nImproves farmers\u2019 livelihood: it allows farmers to produce food, fodder, fuel, and timber from farmland - up to 20% more revenue\r\nReduce amounts of fertilizers: tree-rich farming systems reduce the application of nitrogen fertilizer - lower costs of production\r\nIncrease biodiversity by growing various species at the coffee farms\r\nImprove productivity: Trees in the croplands improve productivity and create carbon sinks - growing coffee and carbon revenues\r\nPrevent deforestation: Tropical deforestation is responsible for 25% of the net annual CO2 emissions worldwide\r\nImprove farmers\u2019 resilience to extreme weather, especially drought and frost\r\n\r\nRoadmap:\r\nStage 1: Prototype & Methodology (September - December 2022) - GR15 funding\r\nPrototype of the carbon sequestration methodology - data collection from farmers and analysis, modeling resources necessary for farm transition, incl. financial, labor, and the time required for transition, calculator of pre-financing needed based on farmer\u2019s data\r\nPrototype onboarding UI for farmers - No-code UI for data collection, farm state visualization, carbon sequestration calculation for farmers, and NFT minting\r\nImplement NFTs and carbon tokens - Farm-specific geospatial non-sellable NFTs with information like location, carbon info, ERC20 tokens for pre-financing of regeneration, NFTs for seasonal coffee purchasing as in the form of an agreement\r\n\r\nWe are participating in the Consensus Hackathon - web3athon - and will have our first prototype released on 20th September 2022. We will accumulate the learnings in a GitBook and share them with the grant supporters. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nStage 2: Build a community & Develop dMRV (January - June 2023)\r\nImprove our carbon sequestration prediction methodology and model various scenarios of farm regeneration based on the initial state and most optimal path to traditional polyculture\r\nOnboard farmers in Colombia and Brazil, build an in-field support operation through existing cooperatives and freelance agronomists, and prototype and test farmer support programs and agroforestry guides. Onboard roasters and coffee carbon investors on the platform test their demand and wishes\r\nDevelop fully-functional dMRV solution for agroforestry in cooperation with the research institutions, agroforestry practitioners, and existing digital MRV solutions (eg. dMeter, MRV Collective)\r\n\r\nStage 3: Launch operations & Form a DAO (July - December 2023)\r\nLaunch full-scale operations in Colombia and Brazil\r\nForm a DAO for farmers and funders\r\n\r\nWe are committed to building a solution that benefits coffee farmers and funders, as well as the entire ReFi community. The methodology we develop will be made open source and accessible to anyone who needs it. We will make our learnings from the field projects and working with funders public and accessible for other regenerators.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nWe are a team of coffee & tech people with various backgrounds and experiences: entrepreneurs, coffee traders and roasters, UX \/ UI designers, climate scientists, blockchain developers, and product managers.\r\n\r\nPartners & Collaborators:\r\nAgrivero.ai - AI-enabled green coffee quality control solution\r\nThe Chain Collaborative - sustainability coffee consulting\r\nDigital Coffee Future - consulting and educational programs\r\nCaventura - carbon-neutral coffee roastery in Berlin, Germany\r\nMRV 101 - work and research group about MRV for small-scale projects\r\nAgroforestry DAO - community united around agroforestry\r\ndMeter - decentralized MRV\r\nMRV Collective - decentralized MRV\r\n\r\nWe are participating in the Consensus Hackathon - web3athon - and will have our first prototype released on 20th September 2022.

Orgassign designed an all-in-one tool that fixed these pain points. It doesn\u2019t bombard you with notifications like Discord, its token-gated permissions are simpler than both Notion and Google Docs, and unlike Github, it\u2019s also designed for non-technical contributors. \u200d\r\n\r\nOrgassign helps contributors increase their efficiency by tracking tasks and goals while also providing a lasting, single point-of-reference so everyone knows what\u2019s being worked on(and why). It manages to do all this with a tidy,intuitive interface.\r\n\r\nOrgassign is a shared contribution space with different sections:\r\n\r\nRoadmap - with goals, projects and tasks showing how everything fits together. Contributors are able to see a clear line between the organization\u2019s overall goal, their team\u2019s efforts, and their individual assignments.\r\n\r\nWiki - is where important information that has more permanence lives. Notes can be added to the wiki using hashtags as you are working on projects, so knowledge management is not a separate task but part of the workflow.\r\n\r\nGroups and roles - manages what individuals can see and contribute to, which can be done through token-gating.\r\n\r\nconclusion\r\n\r\nUltimately, Orgassign is designed to help you work in quite a specific way, making sure plans and tasks add up into an overarching vision(OKR style), and integrating documentation with task management. This is well-suited for DAOs because it retains historical knowledge that would otherwise be lost if individual contributors moved on, a common occurrence in the space.\r\n\r\nUI\r\n\r\n1.Introduce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.What problem does it solve ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.Future updates",

		"description": "kula | \u0915\u0941\u0932\r\n\r\nA Sanskrit word, Kula, translates to \u201ccommunity.\u201d For us, Kula is this, and much more. It embodies the concept of deep belonging in the world and emphasizes our relationships, not just with one another, but with all aspects of the environment (everyone and everything). Kula is about creating this sense of belonging by connecting globally across various sectors of work and engaging locally to actively reshape our future. Being part of Kula, thus, enables us as individuals to synergize and converge holistically on regenerative solutions for localized problems.\r\n\r\nConnecting Globally, and Acting Locally\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed our honeycomb-themed branding. The honeycombs represent our communities, our Kula. Just as bees work collectively, yet individually to create honey, we, as individuals, aim to work separately, but with collective consciousness, to create holistic solutions for our Kula\u2019s localized problems. But before we can begin to act locally, we must create a sense of deep belonging among individuals in our Kula. To do this, we will use art. Art transcends all, brings people together, and allows powerful stories to be told and heard. It also allows for the free flow of information and ideas that will help empower our civic space to continuously reimagine our future and then regeneratively recreate it. As a lateral organization, Kula will rely on art and storytelling to first, mobilize, engage, and then finally empower our community to connect globally and act locally.\r\n\r\nPhases of Work\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Building Our Kula\r\nEstablish and build out our global community in real life and online (the place where Kula will live)\r\nRefine our theory of change emphasizing \u201cconnecting globally, acting locally\u201d\r\nCreate a framework for sustainable global connection, collaboration and learning\r\nIncorporate the usage of art as a driver for creating a civic space for social impact through an NFT drop with global artists connected to grassroots-level causes (this will be our first internal project)\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Launching Publicly\r\nLaunch our first internal project which will help to kick off our slow-growth campaign of onboarding more local organizations and actors\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Scaling Laterally\r\nAllow for more internal projects to emerge through continued global and local conversations, as we scale laterally\r\nBegin to help facilitate individuals to engage at the local level through our partnerships including initiatives, projects, and NGOs across the world\r\nEquip the new generation of development practitioners with the skills they need to tackle grassroots-level challenges through events, workshops and learning sessions\r\n\r\nWhat will funds be used for?\r\nPaying our contributors! The work Kula aims to do is ambitious, but necessary for reshaping our future.\r\nSupporting the livelihood of local actors that wish to engage with our partner grassroots organizations. A lot of times, essential non-profit work goes unpaid, and individuals are unable to meet their personal needs. We want to empower these people to contribute as much as they would like without any personal sacrifice.\r\nFunding projects put forth by our partner organizations.\r\nSeeding internal and external, experimental, and applied research projects that aim to put into practice what Kula stands for.",

Our missing is to bring together buidlers to buidl and maintain valuable Web3 projects in a sustainable manner.\r\n\r\nHow does LXDAO work? First, LX Buidlers post an idea in the community, and buidlers have discussions regarding it. It's like a brainstorming phase. After the idea matures, the LX buidler who is good at product management will start product design, and the project manager will start making a proposal (including dev resources, budgets, etc.) for it. Then the community will vote for it. Once approved, the project manager will start assembling a team from the community with the proper set of skills.  During development, the community will check the progress, and the project manager needs to write weekly for it.\r\n\r\nWe care about sustainability and effectiveness. Even for non-profit and public goods, LXDAO will apply for grants for the project team. And we are good at development, and our community and project management skills will ensure the project will be landed soon with high quality compared with the project made by individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur output or projects are not limited to a specific range, we buidl non-profit and profit projects (for DAO sustainability), and most of our projects are open-sourced. Here is our DAO GitHub https:\/\/github.com\/lxdao-official. More projects will be open-sourced soon. We also make contributions to the whole Web3 industry. For example, our Mirror.xyz editing experience proposal just got approved (Proposal: https:\/\/forum.lxdao.io\/t\/proposal-mirror-xyz-editing-experience-improvement-project\/139 ), we have addressed it is related to a Markdown Open Source project https:\/\/github.com\/commonmark\/commonmark.js\/, and we have found one buidler working on it, make PR for this open source. \r\n\r\nWe will use grants to keep improving LXDAO infra and smart contracts.

		"description": "DeSci Collective seeks to become a gathering point to bring together enthusiasts and leaders from across the global Decentralized Science movement. We bring utility to our members and engage the global crypto community to grow collaboration and support for the Brains & Builders innovating in DeSci. We are active on Twitter and in our Discord. We run bi-weekly Twitter Spaces and are deploying those into a Podcast, which can be found here. We have run 5 episodes to-date over the past two months. Project updates will be posted to our blog. \r\n\r\nOur Purpose\r\nThe DeSci Collective sits at the cross-section of the DeSci movement and capital innovation. Traditional science funding models are too slow, too centralized, and typically influenced by a small group of people who have the same views. Traditional science publishing models are closed systems, too siloed, not inclusive, and reward centralized institutions at the expense of the contributors. DeSci will change this.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIdea to Market\r\nThe DeSci movement is a long-term vision to achieve the dream of open science using Web3 mechanisms and the expected exponential growth of the Web3 ecosystem. The DeSci Collective seeks to contribute to this movement in an action-oriented way as follows: \r\n\r\nCollective members will collaborate across DeSci and within the DeSci Collective to identify action oriented steps and projects that can be successfully achieved today that move us toward the long term vision for each of the Key DeSci Innovation Categories identified below.\r\nThe DeSci Collective will be a launchpad for DeSci builders, helping them go from Idea to Market. We will do this through (a) regular Twitter Spaces & Podcasts featuring hot topics and new projects & builders in DeSci, (b) an active community helping connect builders to talent and community members for their projects, and (c) helping to attract funding to the most promising new builders and projects, including potentially early launch grants from the DeSci Collective itself.\r\nThe DeSci Collective will be active in DeSci community building events and opportunities, including live DeSci conferences and meetups, and helping to support grant opportunities going forward, such as GitCoin DeSci grants.\r\n\r\nKey DeSci Innovation Categories:\r\nDemocratizing scientific publishing, rewarding contributors, and incentivizing reproducibility of research results,\r\nFunding science - for profit impact investments & research grant models,\r\nTokenizing Intellectual Property (e.g. IP-NFTs),\r\nWeb3 Approach for Tech Transfer,\r\nResearch data marketplaces (Data DAOs) - including negative research,\r\nLaboratories as a Service, and\r\nFuture spaces identified by our community and innovators.\r\n\r\nOur Guiding Principles\r\nTransparent. We publish reports on progress and initiatives at least bi-weekly. Twitter and Discord are our primary workspaces.\r\nInclusive. We will make 10% of our DeSci Collective Membership Passes in each cohort freely available to students and other Brains & Builders who seek membership and demonstrate need. We also proactively seek to recruit from underrepresented communities in science.\r\nOpen. We are not beholden to any single DeSci project or umbrella. We welcome everyone and support all positive developments in the space.\u00a0\r\nInnovative. We seek to help support Brains & Builders to launch new projects and innovations. Support can come financially, with advisory services, promotion, or otherwise. No strings attached. We aim to be the launchpad for promising projects in DeSci.\u00a0\r\nProfessional with a Crypto Edge: Our voice will be professional, credible, and constructive. However, we will also seek to include the fun and edge that has defined the broader crypto community, without diminishing credibility. We seek to do serious things while enjoying our time doing so.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNew initiatives need a strong voice at the core early-on to make decisions, operate efficiently, inspire a mission, and attract followers. We will gradually decentralize the DeSci Collective, but want to get it off to a great start with specific initiatives that will be developed by our team at Cherubim Labs with strong input from the DeSci Collective community.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTogether we'll lead the way to disrupt and decentralize science and accelerate scientific achievements globally. That\u2019s it! We welcome you to this community. We seek to delight and surprise you and are eager for your engagement.",

		"description": "SpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase as initial product. Its ultimate vision is to connect Cosmos and Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem, exploring cross-chain and interoperability solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInspiration\r\nWith the development of multi-chain ecosystem, cross-chain has become an extremely important proposition. From asset cross-chain, message cross-chain to interoperability, with the help of proven cross-chain technology, the modular concept will help blockchain achieve a qualitative breakthrough in performance and versatility, which in turn will drive web3 applications towards popularity.\r\n\r\nWe were very excited when Evmos was launched. Cosmos is one of the largest cross-chain solution and ecosystem, Ethereum\/EVM is the largest blockchain application ecosystem. As the EVM hub on Cosmos, Evmos will connect these two ecosystems. Layer2 is the foundation for Ethereum scaling and modular development. zkSync is one of the recognized representatives of zk-rollup and is compatible with EVM. We believe that Cosmos and Ethereum will be combined in terms of cross-chain and modularity. Therefore, we want to explore cross-chain and interoperability solutions based on Cosmos and Ethereum by deploying applications on Evmos and zkSync.\r\n\r\nBecause both Evmos and zkSync are new public chains, the ecosystem is in early stages. We want to build a cross-chain web3 platform that integrates DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase to explore our vision and incubate more applications, becoming the engine of ecosystem. We believe that human exploration into blockchain and exploration into space originate from the same spirit, so we took space as the theme of our product. In this way, SpaceFi was born.\r\n\r\nWhat it does\r\nSpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase as initial product. Its ultimate vision is to connect Cosmos and Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem, exploring assets cross-chain and interoperability solutions.\r\n\r\nSpaceFi is building a fully integrated system, creating sustainable chemistry between modules. You can trade in swap, earn in farm, mint or stake or sell planet NFTs, create or join a spacebase, and invest in new projects. All of this is connected by SpaceFi tokenomics that combines DEFI and NFT.\r\n\r\nDEX:\u00a0You can swap, add \/ remove liquidity. Also, trading mining is in the plan. 1\/3 trading fee will be used to buyback STAR token.\r\n\r\nFARM:\u00a0In single pool, you can stake STAR or Evmos to earn $STAR. In LP pool, you can stake different liquidity to earn $STAR. In NFT poo, you can stake planet NFT to earn $STAR.\r\n\r\nNFT:\u00a0You can use STAR to mint Common Planet NFTs, 90% STAR burning and 10% STAR allocating to NFT bonus and DAO treasury. Further, you can use different Common Planet NFTs to mint Unique Planet NFTs and use different Unique Planet NFTs to mint Exclusive Star Sign NFTs. Each time you mint, equity assets will randomly increase by a certain multiple.\r\n\r\nStaking planet NFTs, there\u2019ll be more rewards than staking STAR token. Also, planet NFTs holders can get bonus from platform fee. In marketplace, you can sell or buy planet NFTs. 5% of the sales will be used as platfrom fee, 70% of which will be used as bonus for NFT holders and 30% will go into DAO treasury.\r\n\r\nSTARTER:\u00a0You can participate IDO of new promising projects in public and private pool. Starter will be an important incubator in ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSPACEBASE:\u00a0Spacebase is on-chain community of spacers. You can use STAR to creat a spacebase, 90% of STAR burned and 10% of STAR allocated to NFT bonus and DAO treasury. Both creators and members can get more rewards when they\u2018re earning in farm.\r\n\r\nHow we built it\r\nThe idea for SpaceFi came from a brainstorming session where we discussed how blockchain would evolve and become popular in the future. We initially focused on celo's financial inclusion and real-world application scenarios in the third world, and conceived the original SpaceFi product based on celo's \"defi for the people\" philosophy. Later, when we came across Evmos and learned about its vision, we realized that the foundation of cross-chain, interoperability, and scalability was needed to popularize the application and improve UE. Therefore, we adjusted our strategy and decided to prioritize building from Evmos. We followed up Evmos testing, and deeply studied Cosmos ecology and Ethereum Layer2 ecology.\r\n\r\nIn mid-March 2022, we deployed SpaceFi on Evmos testnet, and over 10,000 active users participated. In early May 2022, we deployed the Space Swap module on Evmos mainnet with initial mobility. In June 2022, we built spacefi.io validator on Evmos and guide community to actively participate in Evmos governance, currently ranked 31. In early July 2022, we released partnership with zkSync and launched the testnet, generating 1M transactions in just two weeks and becoming one of the most active projects on the zkSync testnet.\r\n\r\nChallenges we ran into\r\nIt'll be a challenge to continue the developing on Evmos and zkSync, especially the cross-chain and interoperability attempts.\r\nTokenomics and the operational data of mainnet. It'll be a challenge to optimize tokenomics to make SpaceFi grow sustainably.\r\nAfter mainnet we will gradually launch community governance. How to balance efficiency, creativity and community incentives will be a challenge.\r\n\r\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\r\nSpaceFi is one of the most active projects on Evmos and zkSync testnet. Many users approved our product and tokenomics and suggested many optimizations.\r\nSpaceFi is becoming a community-driven project, with an community of close to 60,000 members. It's an open, creative and mutual web3 community.\r\n\r\nWhat we learned\r\nWe learned a lot. However, three points impressed us:\r\nWe have gained a lot from our research on Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem, and have become clearer about SpaceFi's vision of building on Evmos and Layer2.\r\nWe need top-down leading and more bottom-up innovation. Governance is especially important, as evidenced in Cosmos ecosystem. Although governance has many drawbacks, such as efficiency and fraud, it can activate community creativity and bring great value.\r\nThink more, dare to think, and be active in trying and practicing. Hesitation, sometimes lost opportunities, can also weaken creativity.\r\n\r\nWhat's next for SpaceFi\r\nPlanet NFT Mint and STAR token IDO, initial liquidity.\r\nEvmos mainnet launch and achieve continuous growth of user data and TVL.\r\nIncubate the first web3 project in community.\r\nDeploy a bridge tool in Evmos and zkSync testnet to transfer STAR assets\r\nzkSync mainnet launch\r\nConnect Evmos and zkSync on mainnet\r\nMore new attempts\r\n\r\nSpaceFi Links\r\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.spacefi.io\/\r\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/spacefi_io\r\nDiscord: https:\/\/discord.io\/spacefi\r\nMedium: https:\/\/space-finance.medium.com\/",

		"description": "Pyme is a web3 marketing platform allowing users to earn tokens, NFTs, and other on-chain and off-chain rewards by completing quests. With Pyme, we aim to onboard and empower the next billion users to web3 by providing everyone with opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Big Statement,\" and rightfully so!\r\nPyme, as you see it today, is just one step in our massive pursuit and ambitions of personal data ownership, data monetization opportunities, web3 accessibility, and a composable, chain-agnostic, decentralized social identity.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince our launch, we have offered over 70,000+ verified users the opportunity to use their data to earn over 220,000+ rewards through quests on Pyme alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAm I late?\r\nNo, you're early! There are new incredible quests on Pyme from the coolest companies and projects. Complete these quests and claim these rewards for yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd companies, you're not late either! Pyme is your opportunity to run campaigns with accurate predictive results. Run campaigns based on on-chain and off-chain verified actions. Reward your users directly for their data and participation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are our plans?\r\nAs we continue to grow, these are the milestones that we're working on at Pyme.\u00a0\r\n\r\nGoing Multi-Chain\r\nWe believe the future of the web3 space is multi-chain. Therefore, Pyme is integrating new blockchains such as AURORA to expand our support to many more projects and companies alongside accessibility for users from the newer blockchains.\r\n\r\nSingular Web3 Identity\r\nConnecting your wallet to every platform is already a challenge. But, then, add in the extra effort of sharing data across projects. That's exhausting.\r\n\r\nThat's why we are working on a single, multi-chain web3 identity. With granular control of your data points, you can conveniently add, remove, control, and share your data. Leveraging the power of protocols such as Unlock, provide timed, restricted access to your data to selected users or even to other projects and companies.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example: Own an ENS Domain? Connect your ENS domain to your data points to get access to quests which require the user to have a configured ENS domain.\r\n\r\nProjects can utilize our SDK to request permissions from the user and get access. Projects no longer need to create extensive systems to collect, store or integrate data points. The SDK will allow on-demand access based on the permissions set by the user.\r\n\r\nVerification and Membership Tiers\r\nWeb3 Projects have a botting problem.

		"description": "Let's make Web 3.0 work for everyone! A study by\u00a0Ariel Investments found that, on average, Black Americans own significantly cryptocurrency than their white counterparts. \r\n\r\nAbout one quarter (25%) of Black Americans own crypto, and when examining investors under the age of 40, that number jumps to 38%. According to the data, 15% of white investors own crypto, and 29% are under 40. According to Entrepreneur Magazine, Black investors were more than twice as likely (11%) to name crypto as their first investment compared to white investors (4%). This means that on average when Bitcoin dropped, yet again this group was on the frontlines of a catastrophe. In my own research (yo soy @Monica_DRRProf) I have found that despite the fact that Black and Latino communities are overexposed to climate and socio-economic degeneration, they are underexposed to the potential benefits of ReFi and DeFi. \r\n\r\nThe Undivide Project wants to host a three-part workshop resulting in training and a clear set of policy recommendations for making DEIA a core part of new Web 3.0 and related crypto regulations. Here are the details: Part 1) Blockchain and Web 3.0 primer, Part 2) Crypto scams versus Crypto opportunities, and Part 3) ReFi and Defi for community upliftment. Each workshop will have a feedback loop about the experiences of the participants in the space. We will take that feedback and make \\\"DEIA for Web 3.0\\\" and ReFi policy recommendations based on the best kind of science, and people's lived experiences. I as the founder of the organization and a former Hill staffer will take personal responsibility for seeing these recommendations through. \\n\\nBecause of the particular overexposure of the Black community to bad crypto deals and lack of access to information about ReFi, DeFi, and the positive aspects of Web 3.0, we will focus on that group immediately but will offer open access to our workshops and depending on funding, offer Spanish language translations. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish our goals, we need to raise $10K. That funding will be used to: pay a fellow to run the social campaign, stipends for the community (we try to hire from communities) coordinators and researchers, speaker fees for disinformation, ReFi and DeFI experts and the costs of workshop venues -- including childcare for parents to be able to afford to attend. \r\n\r\nBelow: Our founder at work on tech, resilience and voluntarism in Baltimore.",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7248\/high-tech-quantum-biology-tweaking-endogenous-qua",
		"description": "Imagine driving cell activities to treat injuries and disease simply by using tailored magnetic fields (MFs). Many disease markers, such as: the production of reactive oxygen species during adult stem cell-mediated regeneration; epigenetic changes to induce pluripotency; cell fate decisions in embryonic stem cells; and cell differentiation of adult stem cells were demonstrated to be controlled by weak MFs (with a strength on the order of that produced by your cell phone), very likely via the electron quantum property of \"spin\". Although exciting, these data are correlative, and the functional relevance of such quantum effects in biology remains unclear. Research has not been able to track spin states to manipulate physiological outcomes in vivo and in real time, without which the potential game-changing clinical benefits of \"quantum signaling\" cannot be realized in the long-term. The goal of this proposal is to, within an accelerated timeline, design and build novel instrumentation to directly measure and control both spin states and their biological consequences at the same time, leveraging our expertise in quantum instrumentation building.\r\n\r\nSpin is an intrinsic quantum property of electrons and some atomic nuclei; it describes how quantum particles interact with magnetic fields. Since such spins make organisms behave, for a short time, as \"living quantum sensors\", we employ established quantum techniques borrowed from the field of technological quantum sensing. The unusual crossover between experimental quantum sensing, developmental biology, and theoretical spin physics is the fundamental strength of our proposal. Combining quantum-inspired instrumentation, theory predictions, and cell bioengineering, we will systematize knowledge on how organisms use endogenous quantum degrees of freedom to function, in an effort to exert control over such phenomena towards a desired physiological outcome.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, the fine-tuning of endogenous \"quantum knobs\" existing in nature will enable the development of drugs and therapeutic devices that could heal the human body via the interaction with weak magnetic fields. A long-term goal is thus to harness spin quantum degrees of freedom to commandeer and drive physiology. Instrumentation we will develop include:\r\n\r\n1) Microscopes coupled to coils and radio-frequency microchips, where specimens (from proteins to both invertebrate and vertebrate cells) will be systematically perturbed by weak magnetic fields. Mid-XX century scientists harnessed the signal provided by biological spins in magnetic resonance imaging \u2013 a technology that, to this day, is used for diagnostics. Here, we will go further and influence spins through magnetic resonance to effect treatment. In contrast to magnetic resonance imaging, our technology relies upon very weak fields (the underlying physical mechanism being different). Our technology will lead to remotely actuated, personalized medicine devices that can predictably alter disease progression using weak magnetic fields.\r\n\r\n2) An electrophysiology setup coupled to coils and radio-frequency microchips where the following hypothesis can be tested. We hypothesize that spin-dependent chemical reactions happening within the cellular membrane might influence the functioning of ion channels; and that, conversely, transient ion fluxes inside the cell might produce weak magnetic fields to tweak widespread spin-dependent chemical reactions. Optogenetics relies on laser excitation to control the opening and closing of ion channels in genetically modified cells. Here, with tailored, weak magnetic field excitation and no genetic modification, we posit it might be possible to deterministically affect ion channel functioning \u2013 with myriad applications for neurological control.\r\n\r\n3) A scanning tunneling microscope coupled to coils and radio-frequency microchips will help decipher why, at room temperature, charge transport through chiral biomolecules favors one spin (\"chiral-induced spin selectivity\", observed first in DNA and \u03b1-helices and presently harnessed in spintronics). Recently, electron transport through a live bacterium nanowire was demonstrated to have such a spin preference, suggesting there is a possibility that other electron transport processes in biology \u2013 most importantly, cellular respiration \u2013 might also exhibit such a spin preference. From a physics point of view, this is highly unusual \u2013 for ex., a quantum computer needs to spend precious resources to prepare electrons that favor one spin. Knowing how transport of electronic \"quantum information\" happens inside chiral biomolecules such as DNA enables the toolkit of quantum physics to be explored towards the control of such quantum information. In practice, this means that quantum methods that control spins via engineered magnetic fields could be applied to tweak physiological processes dependent on electron transport.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the work will bridge the outstanding gap between the theoretical mechanisms of quantum spin effects in biology and the phenomenological evidence of MF effects on cellular behavior, through novel quantum-inspired instrumentation. We will establish unambiguous links between spin-dependent chemical pathways and in vivo metabolism, signaling and cellular physiology. Pushing the frontiers of Quantum Biology, our project will systematically study spins within cells across multiple scales (quantum, molecular, cellular and physiological), visualizing the manipulation of, for ex., regeneration by weak MFs in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We will, for the first time, both measure and control spins within living organisms to influence the regenerative process \u2013 with nanoscale resolution and without the need to manipulate genes. A physicist could describe our approach as the \"coherent control of light-matter interactions, where matter is biomatter\". Having nanoscale electromagnetic handles onto cellular processes will enable the monitoring and selective stimulation or suppression of cellular functions that are electromagnetic in nature. For ex., MFs could be applied in situ in order to reduce uncontrolled reactive oxygen species proliferation; and electron signaling and transport through proteins could be made pathologically weak or strong. A long-term goal is thus to master organismic behavior and metabolic function via the control of native electromagnetic-responsive pathways, using tailored, weak magnetic field excitation.\r\n\r\nCan quantum spin physics be established \u2013 or refuted! \u2013 to account for physiologically relevant biological phenomena, and be manipulated to technological and therapeutic advantage? This is the broad, exciting question addressed by this proposal.\r\n\r\nJustification for need of #DeSci external support\r\n\r\nThe current bottleneck in spin-mediated quantum biology is the lack of high-tech instrumentation that can directly prepare, control and measure endogenous quantum degrees of freedom in biology as if they were bona fide quantum objects (because they are!). Our proposal addresses this bottleneck in that: 1) it is grounded on instrumentation that applies \u2018quantum coherent control\u2019 (i.e., engineered MFs) onto biomatter; and 2) predictions and quantum simulations drive the hybrid quantum biological experiments (in contrast to biophysics studies in which phenomena are modeled after observation).\r\n\r\nThis frontier field is not yet recognized by governmental funding agencies, and not yet relevant to disease foundations. Even with paradigm-altering potential benefits, attempts to fund similar cutting edge projects have been consistently labelled too \u2018biological\u2019 for engineering mechanisms, too \u2018engineering\u2019 for biological ones, and completely out of interest scope by NIH. Moreover, costs and timelines are aligned with those of quantum physics experimental setup development (namely, \u223c $1\u20131.5mi per setup, over a build time of 2\u20133\r\nyears) and as such deemed \u2018too steep\/too slow\u2019 by usual biophysics standards.\r\n\r\nWith medium-term sustained support (5\u20137 years) of our deeply interwoven physics\/biology\/theory operation, we expect not only to realize and share with the quantum biology community enabling instrumentation, but also to showcase initial results that can catapult spin-based quantum biology into a mainstream-fundable area. Present technology in wearables and miniaturization will already suffice to produce tailored, weak MFs that actuate personalized \u2018quantum therapeutics\u2019 in the future. In turn, knowledge generated by experiments to deterministically map \u2018quantum causes\u2019 to \u2018physiological outcomes\u2019 (such as those we will perform) will realistically require at least 1\u20132 decades of maturation until therapeutic deployment. However, without such a sustained support, efforts to develop the required quantum biological technology and incentives for young talent to join the field will both remain distressingly nonexistent.",

		"description": "You've heard of repetition, but what does it mean? Repetition is a tricky subject, and it's hard to define. But it is important for networking purposes. Here are a few tips to help you figure out whether you're using repetition properly. First, embrace your changes. The process of defining your voice and style is like defining your values, beliefs, and priorities. It takes practice and dedication.\r\n\r\nRepetition is a controversial topic\r\n\r\nIn your writing style, you may find repetition to be useful or detrimental. In some instances, repetition serves a purpose, such as reinforcing key ideas or conveying rhythm. However, repetition should never be used solely to pad the word count. If used properly, repetition can make your writing sparkle.\r\n\r\nWhile repeated words and phrases may not be a part of your writing style, they can help make a text more memorable and meaningful. \r\nIn paper writing help online, repetition can be used in many forms, from a single word or line to a whole sentence. It can help emphasize important ideas, convey a sense of rhythm, and enhance your audience's reading experience.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to define\r\n\r\nThere's no right or wrong way to write, and your style will reflect your personality and your writing abilities. But the best way to define your writing style is to let it develop naturally out of your personality. For example, don't try to write like Hemingway or Tom Wolfe. Their style is interesting for its parody, but it sounds forced. Instead, write in a way that reflects your natural style and expresses your individuality.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to improve\r\n\r\nImproving your writing style is not easy, but there are a few things you can do to help yourself improve your style. The first step is to read and study your favorite writers' work. It will help you see how they use various techniques to make their writing interesting and engaging. The second step is to practice writing more, and you will eventually discover your style and voice.\r\n\r\nIt's important for networking\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a strong following, you need to interact on social media. This means responding to tweets and posts, challenging opinions, and listening to others. You should also offer your expertise and give people your time. This will help them form an opinion of you and help them to decide whether to follow you or not.\r\n\r\nIt's important for marketing\r\n\r\nWhether you're writing for yourself or as part of a marketing campaign, your writing style can make or break your marketing efforts. It should be well-organized, concise, and contain a solid sense of substance. Writing should also be relevant and substantive, and be written with your target audience in mind.\r\n\r\nMany elements contribute to your writing style, including the words you use, the formality of your writing, and your vocabulary choice. \r\n\r\nStyle is an important part of communicating with your target audience, and it should be consistent across your communications. Depending on your audience, you may need to use different styles, including a formal tone, a more informal voice, and visual representation.\r\n",

		"description": "TLDR\r\nBoth DAOs and Web3 projects depend on the health of their community and vibez\u2014yet understanding and measuring Community Health is challenging because it relies on the quality and depth of relationship between community members. Without good community indicators, we're often shooting in the dark and less humane metrics get the bulk of the attention, resulting in a more transactional and less community-driven Web3 ecosystem.\r\nThis is an ongoing project to research Community Health metrics and practices, and develop a data collection tool to enable web3 communities to benchmark, track progress, take action effectively, and thrive.\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\nToday, DAOs and Web3 projects are left to rely on the limited reporting provided by Discord or Discourse and a patchwork of \"homemade\" surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are limited, time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results, hampered by poor indicators and\/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\r\nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves community leaders without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes. As a result, many projects measure growth in numbers but not belonging, engagement, trust, and reciprocity. We're at risk of losing the heart and soul of our communities in favour of mechanistic growth.\r\nTo champion real community at the heart of Web3, we've started the Community Health project.\r\n\r\nThe Solution\r\nThe project has three parts:\r\nOngoing research to conceptualise and identify reliable, scientifically-valid, practical and regeneration-inspired community metrics (tight coupling of the Community Health Framework and its associated metrics, and updating the Framework when necessary).\r\nIdentify practices that advance Community Health (including facilitating regular workshops with community leaders and sharing findings) so that problems encountered can be addressed effectively.\r\nDevelopment of an open-source data collection tool that allows operationalising the Community Health Framework by gathering data on community platforms (discord, Twitter, telegram, etc.), processing the data, and providing insights and benchmarking.\r\n\r\nLet's make Web3 community-driven, resilient and humane.\r\nSupport our project!\r\n\r\nFor more info, see the research we have already completed here: Research paper on Community Health.\r\nFor updates, you can also join our telegram group.\r\n\r\nNote: this project is being organised within RnDAO - a research and innovation DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration.",

Bind the Lootverse together with 500 unique inhabitants of the Realms drawn by veteran artists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Lootverse has seen its Realms filled with Heroes and Adventurers but what about the commonfolk? The farmers, bakers, hunters, furriers, fishers, merchants, exotics, and everyday residents.\r\n\r\nThe Loot ecosystem is already brimming with creative energy and talent. We will launch a project that will harness and reward that creativity.\r\n\r\nWith this grant, we will commission artists to populate the Lootverse with Realmsfolk. Each Folk will hail from a specific Realm, feature a unique face, and have a style of dress relative to their life and\/or occupation. Artists and contributors are invited to \u201cLootify\u201d themselves and transpose their likeness into the Realms.\r\n\r\nWe will create a style guide and fee structure so that we can pay artists to draw each and every inhabitant of the Realms. The style guide will give the collection a unified look and feel; any artist who contributes a character will be paid for their work and materials.\r\n\r\nThe size of the collection will be proportional to the grant funding, with a minimum of 500 RealmsFolk and a maximum of 8000 - one for every Realm!\r\n\r\nThe goal is to begin occupying the homes and hovels apart from the adventures. With 500 unique figures, we will be making a small dent in filling the Realms with inhabitants.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is a chance to release a large-scale collection where features are mixed and matched from the original collection.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nAllocation of Funds:\r\nOnce the style guide is established (developed by TicklishArt and Thomas Radio), artists will be invited to contribute their Realmsfolk to the collection. We will pay an $18 flat rate for each contribution that fits the style and format requirements.\r\n\r\n500 commissions x $18 = $9000\r\n\r\nEach contributing artist will also receive a share of the royalties from the sale of the NFT collection. Each Realms inhabitant they contribute will earn them a greater share.\r\n\r\nWhat artists do with their funding is up to them, whether it is to buy supplies or hire models as character studies.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are 500 potential pieces to be made and the goal of open submissions for anyone who would like to get involved.\r\n\r\nA portion of the Grant will be reserved for launching the smart contract. Artists will appreciate a royalty split equal to their contribution to the collection. Estimated at 1.5k USD\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n9,000 USD\r\n\r\nStretch Goal:\u00a0\r\n18,000 USD (just 2 dollars per Realm!)\r\n\r\nIf the funding for this round (GR15) falls short, the project will remain in development (artists are still gonna art) until fully funded.",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7263\/moonjelly-impact-nfts-high-quality-data-to-save-w",
		"description": "MOONJELLY INTRODUCTION\r\nMoonjelly is a global community empowering local heroes and scaling ocean impact world-wide. Our mission is to accelerate science, reward impact, and rewild the ocean. Moonjelly is a proactive public goods funding protocol and thus our prototype below to demonstrate proof of concept will reflect this. In order to proceed, we will prototype, test, and test again to launch a new style of Ocean Impact NFTs with real value and utility.\r\n\r\nOur first Impact NFT project is on whales.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPILOT PROTOTYPE - USING DATA TO PROTECT WHALES AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy whales?\r\n\r\nWhales are a public good. By choosing whales, we line up with a clear narrative that we\u2019re here to build a protocol that promotes the funding and expansion of strong public goods projects. Whales play a key role in sustaining healthy ocean ecosystems and are a vital part in helping to combat climate change naturally in the ocean.\r\n\r\nEvery other breath we take comes from the ocean thanks to phytoplankton, tiny organisms that generate half the photosynthesis on the planet. They capture 40% of all man-made CO2 produced which is the same amount of carbon capture as 1.70 trillion trees. Phytoplankton is key.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlong with many other ecosystem services, whales may help maintain phytoplankton biomass. They have a multiplier effect on phytoplankton and fisheries as whale poop is loaded with iron and nitrogen which feeds and grows phytoplankton as whales cross the oceans, fertilising along the way and in the process creating \u201cThe Whale Conveyor Belt.\u201d More whales = more poop = more phytoplankton = more natural carbon sequestration and stronger fisheries - at minimal cost.\r\n\r\nAll we really need to do is leave them alone and allow them to do their job. With a 60-year life span for humpbacks and up to 200 years for right and bowhead whales, protecting and valuing whales for their incredible ecosystem services could be one of the smartest, most affordable, and most impactful actions toward fighting climate change and rebuilding ocean ecosystems.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 1 - ORIGINAL IMPACT\r\nIn PHASE 1 (Q3\/2022), we work with \u201cOriginal Impact\u201d which is part of our \u201cOriginal Collectables - Science that Changed\/Kick-started Ocean Conservation\" series of NFTs. There always has to be a first - and Original NFTs will honor and reward those achievements.\r\n\r\nWe curate drops in this series with rich storytelling from the impact origin story, driving home why this science and research is important to the world. Science that was not only transformational for conservation but also sparked more research and careers for other scientists in the field. For the buyer, these impact collectibles have the potential to generate exponential value, similar to American rookie baseball cards, as natural capital becomes verifiable, tradable assets in the future.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 2 - FUTURE IMPACT \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nCan funding data collection from satellite tags for migrating whales add to data sets that would help protect whales in certain high risk areas from ship strikes?\u00a0If we could protect X percentage of the whales off the west coast of South America as they migrate back and forth each year between Antarctica and Columbia, we could reduce ship collisions by Y whales per year.\r\n\r\nIn PHASE 2 (Q4\/2022), through our first in a series of FUTURE IMPACT NFT drops, we will be selling Impact NFTs to fund the collection and sharing of high quality data from 50 satellite tags that will show science, shipping companies and policymakers the most important humpback whale areas and highways, from Antarctica to Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of data, we don\u2019t want to manage the whole ocean. Conservation data needs to be specific for policymakers. Humpback whales only need 4-6 weeks of extra protection during the most crucial times when they migrate through high traffic port zones, but more high quality, accessible data is needed to prove when and where specifically.\u00a0Moonjelly Impact NFTs will help create this open source data that currently does not exist. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nMEET ARI FRIEDLAENDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAri is a renowned whale specialist, National Geographic Explorer, and tenured professor at UC Santa Cruz. Ari has long-term ecological research projects ongoing in Alaska, California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Antarctica (with over 40 trips to Antarctica). He has helped in the development of tag technology and visualisation tools to better understand the underwater movements and behaviors of marine mammals.\r\n\r\nMoonjelly has partnered with Ari to sell his first ever Original Impact NFTs and Future Impact NFTs. The first four Original Impact NFTs will wrap the data collected with the impact created and be sold as:\r\n\r\n1. First ever underwater behavior tag deployed on a whale in Antarctica\r\n\r\n2. First ever video tag deployed on a whale in Antarctica\r\n\r\n3. First ever long term satellite tracking tag deployed on a whale in Antarctica\r\n\r\n4. First ever acoustic receiver deployed underwater in Antarctica\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THIS GR15 GRANT WILL BE USED\r\nIn order to save more humpback whales as they migrate up and down the coast of South America every year, we need more high quality, open sourced data (for policymakers and shipping companies). In order to collect and share more data, we need more satellite tags deployed on whales in both Antarctica and Columbia to track the whales as they migrate. In order to fund these satellite tags, Moonjelly will be selling Original and Future Impact NFTs specific to this mission. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis grant will be used to help us build and test our first Impact NFTs for this project, and specifically to test design and functionality for:\r\n\r\nA. The parameters for impact wrapping, and metadata definitions, done in close collaboration with our internal advisors and Moonjelly Academy\u2019s Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC). The SAC is working to build open source frameworks for measuring and valuing impact created in the ocean and co-designing social and ethical guidelines for anti-colonial practices in ocean science;\u00a0\r\n\r\nB. The onboarding process, data sharing, and NFT collaboration for a field scientist, here represented by Ari;\u00a0\r\n\r\nC. Art curation and selection principles, artist onboarding, collaboration and artwork production with chosen artist (TBD) We will work with Moonjelly Academy to explore the ramifications of using art with impact NFTs and guidelines for best practices;\u00a0\r\n\r\nD. Successfully getting an impact wrapped iNFT on chain, and running the transactions for two participant profiles; scientist and iNFT buyer. We will make a minimal functional marketplace capable of minting an iNFT and geared specifically towards ocean impact projects;\u00a0\r\n\r\nE. Finally, we will use this proof of concept to produce and test clear communications of the impacts and benefits this project achieves for the ocean; to explain how our platform works through video prototypes and explainers; to share widely on our social media platforms; to create targeted community campaigns and materials for ocean scientists as well as ocean cultures.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nDeCon (DECENTRALIZED CONSERVATION)\r\nOne of Moonjelly's core missions is to decolonize science and empower people locally everywhere. In PHASE 2, we are collaborating with a Columbian Fulbright scholar (and her team) to do the humpback whale tagging work in Columbia. Ari and his team should not be flying in 2-3 times a year, for short time periods, to Columbia in order to deploy and collect the needed tagging data. Instead, we need local, capable heroes on the ground in these developing nations who are funded (not currently) and doing the needed work full time while also partnering with Ari\u2019s lab on the work. We will have specific Impact NFTs in this collection to fund the Columbian whale tagging team to do this work.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN OF OPPORTUNITY\r\nOnce we prove our concept with the whale project, we have many other powerful ocean projects to follow in our pipeline - such as: monitoring ocean noise to reduce impacts on wildlife, using sound for developing coral reef early warning systems, mapping seafloor biodiversity to avoid impacts associated with offshore development, mapping coastal ecosystems to inform local management decisions, and much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo learn more, or read our investor litepaper, please reach out to impact@moonjelly.io",

Unlike those protocols that only offer lenders at fixed rates, SimpUnion serves both sides of the borrowing and lending market by providing fixed rates.\r\n\r\nIn reality, SimpUnion introduces a concept of unified token called sCash to make all fixed-rate trades possible. sCash allows SimpUnion to tokenize payments in different currencies like ETH or USDC at specific points in the future. sCash is what SimpUnion uses to keep track of lenders, borrowers, debt details, lock-up period\/maturities, maturity dates and so on.\r\n\r\nSimpUnion has two primary features as below:\r\n\r\n1.Longer-dated maturities.\r\n\r\nOn SimpUnion, of course users can choose to borrow or lend in a short term, at a fixed rate. At the same time, there are a lot of people who seek for a long term borrowing\/lending need. The market is huge and SimpUnion fulfills those who need this. Users will be able to fix their interest rates for up to one year initially. And after that, users are allowed to expand maturity with fixed interest rates for up to two years, five years or even ten years.\r\n\r\n2.Flexible dates.\r\n\r\nSimpUnion allows users to lend or borrow to dates that don\u2019t match the maturity of an active liquidity pool. SimpUnion\u2019s innovative collateralization system ensures that users can have more choice regarding the maturity date of their loans without fracturing liquidity across a large number of liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nSimpUnion is a sophisticated system, but it delivers a very simple message : SimpUnion empowers anyone in the world to access the secure and efficient fixed-rate loans by removing traditional financial intermediaries within the Ethereum ecosystem.\r\n\r\nPictures\r\n\r\n1-Home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2-Liquidity pools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3-Liquidation",

What is a good community and what people do within? Join3 has its answer, that is, a good community is capable of helping contributors collaborate and socialize.\r\n\r\nJoin3, an open source Web3 product, is focused on building closer community and helping more organizations transform into DAOs. If you are still waiting, We are sending an invitation letter and giving a hand to you.\r\n\r\nAbout join3\r\n\r\nInvitation to web3\r\n\r\nThe era of working behind closed doors is gone, and the importance of division of work has been aware of centuries ago. In this decentralized world, collaboration is the foundation that makes it work. How to use Web3 technology to record individual contributions and team collaboration, and how to build people's on-chain reputation and social relationships, are topics that cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nJoin3 is building a collaboration-centered system that records the contributions and achievements of members who have reached consensus within the community, and draws a visual map of relationships linked by multiple nodes. In this way, DAO comes into being.\r\n\r\nIs it really that hard to join Web3? We believe that any Web2 or even Web0 organization or member is welcome to become a member of DeSoc. In the name of Join3, we are sending an invitation to you!\r\n\r\nCollaboration Records\r\n\r\nBased on four different types of SBTs, Join3 is able to help organizations record members\u2019 collaborative experiences, identity, achievements and other activities within the community.\r\n\r\nPROJECTs: Proof of Collaboration\r\nROLEs: Proof of Role\r\nSKILLs: Proof of Skill\r\nEVENTs: Proof of Participation\r\n\r\nCollaboration and Social\r\n\r\nWeb3 is a revolution of Relations of Production, and the core of which is decentralized collaboration. We believe that social relation in Web3 is more about decentralized collaboration and value creation, instead of just for entertainment.\r\n\r\nJoin3 has been dedicating to exploring the possibility of collaboration in social interaction, linking the connections among people, organizations, and projects, and eventually forming a collaborative network.\r\n\r\nIn this circumstances, socialization is not a recommendation letter from supervisor or bragging from peers. Combining with a decentralized contribution evaluation tool, Join3 could present genuine recognition among collaborators. Though cooperation, people can make friends, build trust, inspire one other and finally find the ideal collaborators.\r\n\r\nPeople are the sum total of social relations. Your soul in DeSoc is breathed into by Collaboration.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n\r\nJoin3 MVP has completed all product design, currently in the development stage. It is expected to be available for use by 2022 Q4 in a few communities which the team members are in. \u2014We are a group of DAO enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nWe will also finish the design of collaborator social module based on Web3 social protocol in Q4, scheduled to launch in 2023 Q1.\r\n\r\nIn 2023 Q2, A Web3 Collaborator Square will be initiated to help more DAOs and collaborators to build connections.",

Poor incentive structures make it difficult for researchers to secure funding and do not reward the open-access publishing of work, leading to the creation of rigid data silos and an opaque research ecosystem. Taxpayers are a primary funding source for science in today's system, but then have no involvement in the selection of what research gets funded and have limited transparency into progress and results.\r\nEach year, trillions of dollars are invested in scientific research projects around the world. There exists an opportunity to expand community involvement and redesign incentives so that a wider pool of owners, investors, and benefactors are activated. By addressing these problems, we can accelerate the pace of human discovery and restore public trust in the scientific process.\r\n\r\nGoals for GR15\r\n-Connect back-end and smart contract logic to the current UI on EVM-compatible testnet (Mumbai and\/or Alfajores)\r\n-Perform proof-of-concept and feasibility testing of transfer of ownership workflows\r\n-Complete demo research project flow with dummy project\r\n-Finalize parameters in tokenomics model using Machinations.io and\/or tokenSPICE\r\n\r\nTeam\r\nBrett Cornick: LinkedIn | Twitter\r\nBrett has 7 years of first-hand experience funding, conducting, and commercializing scientific research.

Within 6 weeks, we successfully reduced the concentration of community governance rights from 100% to 80.2% by incentivizing community members to participate and awarding governance points weekly.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment, we explored the distribution of collaborative task contributions.

		"description": "4EVERLAND is a Web 3.0 cloud computing platform that integrates storage, computing, and network core capabilities. It aims to help the user to make a smooth leap from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 and become the infrastructure for millions of Web 3.0 developers and applications.\r\n\r\n\tMission: To help users make a smooth leap from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\r\n\tVision: To be the infrastructure for millions of Web 3.0 developers and applications.\r\n\tPositioning: A blockchain technology-powered, cloud computing platform for Web 3.0.\r\n\r\nOverall technical design of 4EVERLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to use us now\r\n\r\n1.Hosting Service: Hosting Dwebs or Dapps on IPFS, ICP, and Arweave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers can quickly deploy websites to IPFS through a Github authorization or a Cli local build via 4EVERLAND Hosting service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENS & SNS & IPNS\r\nWe integrate ENS, SNS, IPNS, etc. to power the DWeb more censorship resistant and provide one-stop DWeb services for users.\r\n\r\nFrameworks Compatibility\r\nOur service works for Vue, Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt.js, etc. almost all sites & popular frameworks.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHigh Performance at Access\r\nAll DWebs built through 4EVERLAND will enjoy the global acceleration and a variety of services from the 4EVERLAND gateway.\r\n\r\n4EVERLAND Hosting is just like a decentralised Vercel, offering a convenient front-end hosting service. Web2 has independently demonstrated this in the market, and Vercel is today valued at more than $2.5 billion. Decentralized front-end hosting is currently the last stage towards the complete decentralization of applications for all Dapps and Web3, where there is a much greater immediate need for it.\r\n\r\nThe community and users are becoming more and more in agreement with front-end decentralization, and in the future, this is sure to become a norm for Dapps as well as smart contracts, especially in light of all the recent episodes of frontend hi-jacking and centralized intervention.\r\n\r\nGetting started: https:\/\/www.4everland.org\/hosting\r\n\r\n2.Bucket Service: Store file on IPFS or Arweave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKET enables users to upload, store, and fetch files from the IPFS and Arweave in a secure, convenient, and efficient manner. BUCKET is also compatible with AWS S3 application programming interface, CLI, and other upload methods, making it easier for users to use our product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIPFS & Arweave & More\r\n4EVERLAND is the first storage aggregator to integrate both IPFS and Arweave to provide users with multiple decentralized storage protocols. More storage protocols will be gradually supported in the future.\r\n\r\nGlobal Acceleration\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAll files stored in IPFS or Arweave via Bucket will enjoy the global acceleration service provided by 4EVERLAND, which guarantees the transfer, access and read speed of files.\r\n\r\nS3 Compatible\r\nBucket is fully compatible with AWS S3, which will allow Bucket users to use S3's API or SDK to seamlessly and easily switch the Dapps storage layer to IPFS or Arweave.\r\n\r\n4EVERLAND Bucket, as a decentralised AWS S3, covers a wider storage market. Growth in various areas, such as NFT, Metaverse, Gamefi, etc., will create greater demand for storage. \r\n\r\nArdrive is a component of the AR segment in addition to Pinata in the IPFS sector. All of the large valuation investment for Filswan and Lighthouse, which offer Filecoin higher layer apps, has been accomplished. \r\n\r\nThis demonstrates the market's strong bullishness regarding the development of storage applications. In comparison to these development tools, 4EVERLAND Bucket provides a more web2-compatible, low-threshold approach to development as well as a more complete storage solution.\r\n\r\nGetting started: https:\/\/www.4everland.org\/bucket\/\r\n\r\n3.4EVERLAND Gateway Service& Gateway Explorer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4EVERLAND Gateway is dedicated to making various Web3 protocols and blockchain networks compatible with Web2, as well as delivering high-performance and high-availability network service capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Acceleration\u00a0\u00a0\r\n4EVERLAND's gateway offers higher performance and globally accelerated network services through over 200 gateway nodes around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nCustom Domain\u00a0\u00a0\r\n4EVERLAND allows you to add a custom domain to the dedicated gateway with a simple configuration.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSSL Certificate\u00a0\u00a0\r\n4EVERLAND offers a free automated certificate service for all users who bind a custom domain, thus ensuring that all communication between the browser and the website being browsed is encrypted.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe have upgraded the public gateway service into IPFS explorer service form to provide convenience to a wide range of users in IPFS search.\r\n\r\nGetting started: https:\/\/www.4everland.org\/ipfs\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibilities\r\n\r\n4EVERLAND can help everyone rebuild the Web's foundation layer and transition to a new and unbiased Web3.0.\r\n\r\nDApps can be created without centralized components\r\n4EVERLAND uses a decentralized network system that integrates core services such as storage, computing, and networking, enabling data storage and business logic to run on a decentralized network instead of centralized services like AWS or Google Cloud.\r\n\r\nProvide multiple ecological resources\r\n4EVERLAND integrates the underlying public chains of Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, Filecoin, etc., and supports various forms of inter-blockchain information exchange, so that developers can quickly implement multi-chain deployment and multi-chain communication to enjoy the various ecological resources.\r\n\r\nCompatible with the traditional development environment\r\n4EVERLAND provides a series of development and deployment tools, compatible with EVM, WASM, etc., Easily coupled and integrated, so that Web 2.0 developers can quickly complete the development and deployment of DApp without any additional learning costs.\r\n\r\nWrite once, Run any blockchain\r\n4EVERLAND helps developers to initiate write once, run any blockchain' programming paradigm by integrating various public chains and solving the differences between public chain protocols. In addition, it enables developers of each public chain to deploy contracts and front ends once and achieve a fully decentralized technical architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPartners\r\n\r\n4EVERLAND use the way of integration to integrate core capabilities such as storage, network, and computing in the Web3.0 field. At the same time, we are also integrating resources from various ecosystems to empower all developers. At present, we have made cooperative relations with many protocols and public chains to jointly contribute to the construction of Web3.0 For example: IPFS,Arweave, Filecoin, Polygon, zkSync, ENS, Bonfida, Harmony, METIS, NEAR, OKC, HECO and so on.\r\n\r\nResource\r\n\r\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.4everland.org\u00a0\r\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/4everland_org\u00a0\r\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/org_4everland\u00a0\r\nDiscord: http:\/\/discord.gg\/Cun2VpsdjF\u00a0\r\nReddit:\u00a0https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/4everland\/\u00a0\r\nMedium: https:\/\/4everland.medium.com\/\u00a0\r\nEmail: contact@4everland.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Water is earths most abundant resource, and yet collectively, we somehow struggle to provide clean water for billions of people on a regular basis. Of course, this is because only 1% of the earths water is available to us as fresh water. So how can we solve this?\r\n\r\nInnovation happens at a rapid rate when there is an economic incentive to innovate. The ReFi DAO Water Circle aims to create that incentive through creating a desalination credit that individuals and corporations can use to offset their water usage. Desalination is currently costly, energy intensive, and leaves a leftover brine concentrate. We can create a tiered credit system that will force technologies to innovate in order to produce a more premium credit.\r\n\r\nThe ReFi DAO has begun community circles where founders can focus on specific areas they are passionate about in the space. Our group is knows as the Water Circle where we explore ways in which we can bring about positive change in water treatment and availability around the world. We believe that we have found a path where we can have a significant impact through the creation of a standardized water credit. The goal is to create a standardized water credit that a whole water credit ecosystem can be built off of. This may sound ambitious, but isn't that what we do in the blockchain world? We want to carry out this project because we believe that we can create that first step by creating a desalination credit. Carbon credits came to acceptance in the traditional space, we want ReFi to lead the charge on water credits. \r\n\r\nWhy do we need grant funding?\r\n\r\nIn order to drive this forward we need one of two things, either a lot of research help from the community to help us get this going (which many amazing people in the space have been willing to already contribute), or we need some grant funding so that we can hire a some research help and in a best case scenario enough to run our own pilot project. \r\n\r\nHow will you know how the funds are being managed?\r\n\r\nWe will be posting constant updates inside the ReFi DAO Water Circle tab. The goal is to be as transparent as possible with exactly how funds are being used and progress being made. You can also DM James the Water Circle lead and ecoToken founder anytime on Discord to ask questions about the progress\r\n\r\nWhat actually needs to be done?\r\n\r\nWe want to follow the process of creating credits on the Regen Network. To do this we first have to finish developing our credit class and submit the official concept note. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "##Introduction\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe importance of NFT(Non-Fungible Tokens) is growing rapidly not only in blockchain ecosystem but also in real-life industry. Their traits such as rarity, uniqueness, validity are used in field such as gaming, entertainment, sports, etc. However, the swiftly growing industry has some barriers to newcomers. First, the information is scattered all around the internet that it\u2019s hard to keep track of them. Second, it\u2019s hard to find reliable information because of the broad amount of information in the market. Lastly, evaluation of NFTs is difficult due to lack of quantified metrics in the field.\r\n\u00a0\r\n##Problem\r\n\u00a0\r\nCurrently, NFT investors rely on individual subjective data created by \"influencers\" who independently provide information in messenger-based communities such as Discord, Blog, Twitter, and Telegram. In this situation, investors use various media to obtain information about NFT, and investors\u2019 anxiety about the market is prevalent as they rely on unclear messenger-based media for specific information or un evaluation of NFT. In addition, there are cases in which investors are deceived by the information providers because there is no verification process. For example, many report cases of failure after investing in projects that are falsely promising, which are promoted and advertised by the influencers.\\n\\nAs the NFT market is a new market, fraud using information asymmetry is actively taking place. For example, copying fraud, in which existing intellectual property rights (IPs) that are not registered as NFTs are newly registered as a NFT by a third party, or when content that is already registered as NFT is copied and published, is creating confusion and damage for novice investors. Furthermore, there are frequent cases of deceiving investors, such as stealing and exploiting card and blockchain wallet information by impersonating NFT exchanges or employees, and rugs that disappear after receiving investment for NFT projects. \r\n\r\nFor investors, to avoid being subjected to impersonation fraud and rugpool, a system must be established to carefully examine and verify the history of the project group. However, it is difficult for retail investors to obtain fraud-related information, and many NFT investors are exposed to this risk due to the problems of the messenger-based community as mentioned above. This has led to greater distrust of the NFT market and acts as a hindrance to the growth of the NFT market.\r\n\r\nThese problems can all be solved in Sigmate. The revolution of NFT ecosystem aggregates the data to maximize your experience.\r\nThe following are our current and future services:\r\nScattered information is gathered and written in Wiki format.\r\nKnow everything about NFT: such as past rug-pulls, wallet address of current owner, floor price, mint price, etc.\r\nKeep project announcements updated without using Discord and Twitter.\r\nEnsure reliability through cross-validation between users and Sigmate.\r\nKeep notified with upcoming NFTs projects with your own calendar.\r\nWrite your own wiki page and earn token using write-2-earn system.\r\nTalk about your NFTs and share your opinions that are sorted by different categories.\r\nEvaluate your NFTs with our index and metrics.\r\nWin NFTs and whitelists with our Draw.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n##Solution\r\n\u00a0\r\nNFT has a number of collections that produce a variety of series on one subject. Traditional Wikipedia takes the form of a simple introduction to the NFT exchange rather than an introduction to these collections. We are planning to provide detailed and detailed information on all NFTs in the collection as individual pages. In addition, we will increase user convenience by providing UI\/UX specialized in providing NFT information.Users can create and edit wiki in Sigmate platform. Editing articles will reward users based on the word count and the effort. Once users are given the credibility with reliable edits, higher rewards will be compensated. After TGE, Sigma Tokens will be distributed according to the contributions of users.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\nTo help NFT investors make properinvestment decisions, Sigmate provides features that protect users from the risk of copying fraud. By linking APIs provided by Etherscan to provide real-time tracking of whose wallet a specific NFT is on the blockchain, users can check whether NFT is true or not easily. This solves the problems that first-time NFT investors face in the process of collecting distributed information and ensuring trust for users, as well as barriers to entry, which can increase new NFT investors and help the NFT market to grow.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Community\r\nBecome the part your NFT community in Sigmate. Lack of space to freely share your opinion of projects hinder the growth of NFT community. Share your thoughts more freely and less formally in Sigmate.\r\n\r\nWe plan to update announcements in various project communities in real time to collect distributed information and provide convenient functions so that information about projects can be easily checked without accessing each community one by one. NFT project provides their community with whitelists and OGs before the mint. Investors must go through certain tasks that the NFT projects require through Discord Channels. For investors without much experience and knowledge in NFTs, it is difficult to get a whitelist position. To help and shorten investors\u2019 time and effort, we will collect and provide projects\u2019 how-to-whitelist guides in Sigmate.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStats\r\n\r\nThe valuation of NFTs has always been a question of investors. Due to lack of liquidity, speculation, and diversity, the evaluation has been hindered.\r\nIt\u2019s important to know the correct value of your data in Web 3.0. Sigmate\u2019s algorithm allows you to compare you NFTs with our indices. Correlation between them can help you to evaluation your NFTs.\r\n\r\nNFT Calendar\r\n\r\nManage and keep yourself updated with the watchless upcoming NFT projects along with your personal calendar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaximize your NFT experience with Sigmate!\r\nYou can find out more on our channels below:\r\nWebsite|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Discord\u00a0|\u00a0Telegram | Medium",

Brainstorm, if you have any good ideas, please join us and we will help you make it happen.\r\n\r\nHow we works\r\n\r\nFor the whole community, there are three types of people, they are the managers, the developers and the community members. We have created a sub-section of the community to share your Web3 ideas and anyone can post your comments on it. Ultimately the community will vote to chose a project that the community agrees to develop.\r\n\r\nFor developers without a good idea, TheWeb3DAO is a great place to find innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nFor brainstormers without development skills, TheWeb3DAO is the place to find  partners and, of course, technically gifted developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first landing platform developed by the community, TheWeb3Portal, is now live. TheWeb3Portal is a Web3 navigation site for all users and Web2 web developers. TheWeb3DAO members will help the front-end deployment of traditional Web2 websites on IPFS to achieve decentralization and integrate the deployed websites into TheWeb3Portal website for users to search and access.\r\n\r\nThe future we expect\r\n\r\nWhat we look forward to in the future is an increasing number of members joining our community, including developers of all kinds. Everyone will be able to freely discuss development projects in their own subsections.\r\n\r\nTheWeb3DAO will set up a special fund to help incubate good projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nResource\r\n\r\nTheWeb3Portal \r\n\r\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.web3-portal.org\/\r\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Web3_Portal\r\n\r\nTheWeb3DAO\r\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheWeb3DAO\r\nDiscord: http:\/\/discord.gg\/UQg3VZ2FpB\/\r\n",

		"description": "TLDR;\r\n\r\n\r\n85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work. That\u2019s a clear sign that work needs an upgrade. We at Eden Protocol set out to build that upgrade in the form of a decentralised, community driven solution that helps people find the right project to contribute to - and vice versa, starting in DAOs - eventually spread across web3. We are working with enthusiastic devs from DeveloperDAO, crypto natives from BanklessDAO. We are fully community driven, which is why we\u2019re here, talking to you, hoping to rely on the crypto community via donations and grants to help us in our journey to unlock the passion economy for everyone in the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n\r\nEden will be the world's opportunity protocol, providing a place where everyone can find work they love and grow, thanks to our two-way person-project matching system. This system is Eden's core, built from an ML-driven assistant, a platform-like interface, and some epic mechanics.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCommunities can integrate Eden into Discord, Slack, Telegram, or wherever they are. Think of it like an assistant that always learns and works as an automated, personal project scout; it flags the most relevant individuals for projects and vice versa. With this, Eden will open opportunities on all ends of the web3 ecosystem by streamlining overwhelming discord servers, convoluted onboarding processes and outdated notion tables. The result is brilliant talent coordination & resource allocation, minus the headache.\r\n\r\nCheck out our alpha demo here:\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMission Statement\r\n\r\nOur purpose is to make work, work for all.\r\nOur vision is to build an opportunity protocol built on the principles of purpose & community.\r\nOur mission is to unlock community powered economic opportunities.\r\nOur values:\u00a0\r\nGrowth: No-one is born with all their skills, thoughts, connections, ideas,... fully developed. Growth is the ultimate super power that we aim to foster in everyone & in ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nCommunity: Everything starts with people coming together. We play longterm games with longterm people. There is no stronger foundation than strong, caring & genuine connections.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nPurpose: There is nothing more powerful than the human soul on fire. If community brings people together, purpose gives them direction. We are & foster cathedral-builders.\u00a0\r\nOpportunity: Luck is an attitude. By creating the right environments you can make luck a lot more likely. We create environments where better opportunities can happen at higher frequency.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nForesight: The best way to predict the future is to create it. We actively think from first principles to find better ways. We are foresight pioneers.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nImpact: We care about what you can do more than what you did. We hack value, before we hack growth. We\u2019re intentional about the change we intend to make.\u00a0\r\n\r\nKey principles\r\n\r\nImagine purpose & community being the key reasons people come together to learn, earn, connect & collaborate. What would an opportunity protocol that enables such a purpose & community-driven economy, look like? A simple idea with massive potential impact.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPurpose-led work-agency\r\nCommunity-powered = community owned\u00a0\u00a0\r\nPlay together\r\nTake the robot out of the human\r\nUnlimited potential\r\nFrom hindsight-dwellers to foresight-pioneers\r\n\r\nFor more info, please check out our manifesto here.\r\n\r\nTechnical specs\r\n\r\nFew bullet points on the tech stack\r\n\r\nHardhat\u00a0\r\nSolidity\r\nCreate-web3-js\r\nopenzeppelin\u00a0\r\nNextjs\r\ntailwindcss\r\nreact redux\r\nredux\r\n\r\nRoadmap:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stage 0\r\n\tApril 2022\u00a0\r\nInitial set of ideas at ETH Amsterdam\r\n\tMay 2022\u00a0\u00a0\r\nFirst POC demoed in multiple DAOs\r\n\tJune 2022\u00a0\r\nAnchored in D_D\r\n\tJuly 2022\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBuilt a team of 25 contributors to take lessons learned from POC to MVP in 4 user-stories\r\nHeld weekly town hall meetings in D_D to discuss vision, concerns, problems, and successes\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stage 1\r\n\tAugust 2022 [from alpha to beta]\u00a0\r\nDeploy MVP in stages in D_D\r\nSmart Bot for p2p matching\r\nOnboarding flows\u00a0\r\nLaunching a project on Eden\r\nInterface for p2p matching\r\nV1 of Endorsements\r\nConduct extensive user testing with the goal to iterate until D_D absolutely loves the product test parts of the MVP\r\nContinue weekly town hall meeting in D_D\r\nRaise grants to\u00a0\r\nProvide a minimum of 4 months of compensation for a steady core team, to dedicate more time as we integrate feedback\u00a0\r\nPay (early) contributors, who have been with us from the start, to compound on their involvement, knowledge accumulation & drive for the project\r\n\tSeptember 2022 [from alpha to beta]\r\nContinue user testing with D_D\r\nIntegrate all testing feedback\r\nContinue web3 grant raising efforts\u00a0\r\nSelectively approach other DAOs to participate in private beta of Eden Protocol\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stage 2\r\n\tOctober 2022 - December 2022 [build, measure, learn]\r\nSelectively approach other DAOs to participate in private beta of Eden Protocol\r\nIterate MVP until multiple DAOs are raving about our private beta \r\n[hack value, then hack growth]\r\nIntegrate feedback with core team + contributors\r\nKick raising efforts into high gear, preferably web3 grants - to prepare for the post MVP phase.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stage 3\r\n\tJanuary 2023 [secure raise for the\/our future of work]\u00a0\r\nDemonstrably have value markers\u00a0\r\nClose a 2 year runway for a core team, preferably through a community raise\r\nGo out of private beta\u00a0\r\n\tFebruary-March 2023 [grow grow grow]\u00a0\r\nStart dev & integration of post MVP features: Social & Intellectual Capital Gating & Staking, Tokenomics\u00a0\r\nPedal to the metal on go-to-market\u00a0\r\n\tApril 2023 [start building protocol features]\u00a0\r\nContinue dev & integration of post MVP features:Social & Intellectual Capital Gating & Staking, Tokenomics\u00a0\u00a0\r\nPedal to the metal on go-to-market\u00a0\r\nEvolve into a full blown opportunity protocol\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nMain Contributors:\r\n\r\nMiltos | BluePanda#5982 - Tech Lead\r\nMiltos is a PhD-ML-Dropout with previous experience as a senior ML Engineer at multinationals & CTO of multiple startups.

Leevtis\u2019s mission is to build a protocol that allows anyone to program arbitrary rules into a badge that can be claimed. Making these badges more accessible to other users, decentralized applications and protocols will help drive interesting behaviors and endless use-cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb3 empowers anyone from the world, for the first time in history, to interact with any decentralized application on a \u201cshared state device\u201d--where all records of these interactions are immutably stored on a public database. At Leevtis, we believe that both understanding these on-chain interactions and digital footprints and making them useful through badges will be one of the most important primitives upon which the Web3 stack is built over the next decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough Leevtis, users are able to discover on-chain achievements curated by the community and mint them as non-transferable NFTs called \u2018Badges\u2019. It is implemented as a set of smart contracts and a validating oracle to provide composable badges and built-in on-chain data validation. Publisher of a badge can deploy specific badge standards\u2014which includes detailed metadata of the on-chain achievement and eligibility criteria\u2014to the blockchain. When a user attempts to claim a badge, Leevtis\u2019s validating oracle\u2014which fetches and synchronizes Ethereum blockchain data\u2014provides proof for the Leevtis Protocol by analyzing the user\u2019s historic transaction data and validating whether or not the user is eligible.\r\n\r\nLeevtis aims to contribute to build up a more collaborative and meritocratic network where one\u2019s contribution, participation and reputation is valued. Therefore, the Leevtis is, by design and implementation, a complete system that could shape the fabric of how Web3 users interact and how applications and protocols are built to understand them",

Our \u201cno-code\u201d front end enables communities to create a\u00a0Moloch DAO\u00a0in under 10 minutes at no cost aside from gas on a number of EVM compatible blockchains. We create open source tools and libraries that enables the DAOhaus framework to be used as a public good, in line with our mission to foster a diverse, open economy of transparent cooperation.\r\n\r\nDAOhaus\u2019 Social Impact\r\n\r\nDAOhaus is committed to a community first culture that furthers the development of the web3 DAO ecosystem. Our culture has attracted thousands of DAOs to launch on our platform like:\r\nMetaCartel Ventures: An investment DAO with over $6.6M TVL\r\nMoloch Rises: A grants giving DAO with over $2.5M TVL\r\nGame Mine Alliance: A P2E game community with over $2M TVL\r\nDiamondBank: A data science DAO with $370K TVL\r\nRaidGuild: A service DAO with over $200K TVL\r\nWe have built a considerable following (15.7k followers on Twitter and 6,300 members in Discord)\u00a0that\u00a0allows us to act as stewards for the community by advocating, discussing, and sharing knowledge that improves the DAO ecosystem.\r\nOne of our\u00a0programs,\u00a0HausParty\u00a0is a weekly tradition that started in our server and recently grew to Twitter Spaces. Our lively discussions tackle issues we face in our communities and provide a space for people to openly talk about them. Some of our shows include:\r\nHausParty Live featuring Raid Guild Season 1 Cohort\r\nHausParty Live featuring Pet3rPan\r\nHausParty Live featuring the DAOhaus community\r\nOur community members also publish content relevant to the community on\u00a0Mirror\u00a0and\u00a0Substack. Their articles have covered the basics of Moloch DAOs, DAO governance patterns, and more.\r\nOur platform has over 3,000 DAOs summoned, almost 45,000 proposals created, and approximately $100,000,000 in funds passed through treasuries. (source:\u00a0stats.daohaus.club) DAOhaus has also been featured in noteable publications like\u00a0Decrypt,\u00a0Forbes, and\u00a0HackerNoon.\r\n\r\nDAO Experimentation\r\n\r\nExperimentation is built into the core of DAOhaus. We believe the only way to push the ecosystem forward is by trying new and innovative approaches.\r\nWe launched\u00a0DAOgroni\u00a0to experiment with a new \u201cfair launch\u201d NFT project that combines the power of an ERC721 token and a Moloch DAO. DAOgroni allows anyone to mint an NFT that may be burned for shares in the DAO with the mint proceeds going directly to the DAO treasury.\r\nWe also developed\u00a0Yeet, a web3 crowdfunding tool with built in DAO governance. When a person contributes to Yeet, they gain shares in the initiative that protects their interest via the \u201cragequit\u201d mechanism.\r\nDuring the recent market downturn, we experimented with a new form of governance. DAOhaus transitioned from a retroactive compensation model to a RFP system to extend runway and focus contributors on specific objectives for the DAO.\r\n\r\nWhat Grant Funds Will Be Used For\r\n\r\nWe are on the verge of deploying DAOhaus v3 which introduces a new, composable platform that unlocks the next level of coordination for DAOs.\r\nThe grant funding will be used to support our team of contributors including the development team that is working on delivering DAOhaus v3. This also includes covering security audits.\r\nSecurity is a top priority for DAOhaus v3 smart contracts and frontend. As an open-source product built as a public good, we are committed to taking the appropriate steps to properly audit our contracts. This will ensure our contracts are battle tested and ready to be unleashed into the wild.\r\n",

This is achieved by allowing users to create profiles and interact with each other via these profiles. \u201cProfile\u201d (as used here) refers specifically to Scopefy profiles; \u201cuser\u201d refers to standard crypto wallets.\r\n\r\nThe Protocol is currently overseen by a multisig, which will be expanded to a broader DAO that can develop and vote on new modules and expanded functionality.\r\n\r\nLet's first dig into profile creation and publishing. Users must create a profile on the hub, for which they will receive a sequentially ID'd profile NFT.

		"description": "\r\n\r\n1] What is Dolven Labs and How does it work?\r\n\r\nDolven Labs is a DAO Based Ecosystem Catalyst for projects built on the StarkNet Network it is an initiative to empower, accelerate and support innovative projects in the StarkNet ecosystem by providing them with early-stage investment. We aim to be the future of investment, deal flow, and value creation in the StarkNet ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAbout how it works is very simple: We provide early-stage investment to projects built on the StarkNet Network. This process of investment needs to be fair and effective at the same time. Therefore we have Dolven Labs DAO, the projects that apply for investment are forwarded to DAO for voting, and if they receive a majority, they will receive an investment from the Dolven Labs Mutual Fund.\r\n\r\n2] What is Dolven Labs DAO and How to become a part of it?\r\n\r\nDolven Labs DAO is what holds the decision-making power in Dolven Labs, like to decide which of the applicant projects will receive an early-stage investment, voting is held and our DAO members cast their votes. The project which receives most votes is then handed out an early stage investment.\r\n\r\nThe members of our DAO are called Delegates. We use staking to incentivize and reward users for holding $DLV and include them directly in the StarkNet ecosystem. When you stake $DLV token on Dolven's staking platform, you have an option to become a Delegator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3] How does Dolven Labs plan to be Sustainable?\r\n\r\nDolven Labs is an initiative to empower, accelerate and support innovative projects in the StarkNet ecosystem, enabling them to push their boundaries and achieve their goals. To enable this, we need to implement an investment strategy that can withstand all types of markets. It is important to us that we continue our support for projects in the Starknet Ecosystem not only in a rising market but also in a declining market.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo ensure the Dolven Mutual Fund continues to invest in projects built on Starknet, we are building tools that hit two birds with one stone. The first bird is Dolven Labs mutual fund, with the continued investment we run into the risk of depleting our investment fund, therefore, we need to add funds to it which brings us to our second bird which is accelerating building in Starknet.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBuilding on Starknet can be hard, even with an experienced team the learning curve can pose challenges that can offset your target Roadmap with unforeseen complications. To counter this we are introducing to you our sustainability tools which are designed to accelerate your Starknet experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4] Dolven Labs Vision and Roadmap.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe aim for Dolven Labs to be a go-to platform for new projects in the StarkNet ecosystem for early-stage investment. The strength of Dolven Labs is being transparent and fair to its community with more users joining in, Dolven Labs would effectively become a major player in the StarkNet ecosystem and become a true game-changer.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur primary goal will always be to add value to Starknet and facilitate its healthy growth.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs per the roadmap, we have launched our Testnet eligibility program on August 17th, 2022 and the response has been overwhelmingly positive, we will be releasing our Testnet in parts, the first part being available by end of September 2022, and the others will follow soon.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more details about Dolven Labs visit:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Docs: https:\/\/docs.dolvenlabs.com\/\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Website: https:\/\/dolvenlabs.com\/\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Linktree: https:\/\/linktr.ee\/dolvenlabs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "\r\nWhat is PsyDAO?\r\n\r\nTLDR;\r\n\u00a0\r\nPsyDAO aims to fund and democratize early-stage psychedelic research and IP through the use of tokenized ownership, community governance and an emphasis on open source.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of a psychedelic renaissance. Psilocybin, LSD, MDMA and ketamine \u2013 compounds once regarded as recreational drugs \u2013 are being re-examined as legitimate medicines to treat mental health conditions. The rush of companies entering the psychedelic industry has led to an influx of patent applications, marking the beginning of the journey to commercialization.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt PsyDAO we believe that these life-changing compounds should be developed and commercialized in a way that is values-aligned with the patients, users, researchers, investors and communities that come together to develop them. This is why we are forming a decentralized, autonomous, member-owned organization (DAO) dedicated to the sustainable and ethical advancement of psychedelic medicines.\r\n\r\nPsyDAO intends to be a hivemind \u2014 a literal collective consciousness for the ethical development of psychedelics \r\n\r\nPsyDAO aims to fund and democratize early-stage psychedelic research and IP through tokenized ownership, community governance and open source technology. Where applicable, PsyDAO will hold IP rights in underlying research projects that it supports, which will be attached to \u2018IP NFTs\u2019. For compounds where IP claims are possible, PsyDAO will develop a portfolio that is actively managed by the community in an aligned way to democratize development and access. For naturally-occurring compounds such as psilocybin, PsyDAO aims to create powerful, open-source data repositories that will be governed by the community.\r\n\r\nThe IP tokenization system is a mixture of meme magic and mathemagic. Built with our friends at Molecule and VitaDAO, it enables PsyDAO to create open research and participation markets for known psychedelics, selectively distributing rights and benefits to partners and contributors.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent status of PsyDAO:\r\n\r\nWe are in the early stages of building a DAO. We have assembled an amazing group of core contributors and stewards, identified several exciting psychedelic research projects and cultivated a community of supporters over 1000 strong.\u00a0\r\n\r\nResearch Projects we are supporting:\r\n\r\nPart of PsyDAO\u2019s mission is to support open source projects that advance Psychedelic medicine and Science. Two projects we are currently supporting are:\r\n\r\nThe Open Ketamine Project, in collaboration with Crowd Funded Cures - working to make an off-patent version of Ketamine available to patients at lower cost than patented versions\r\n\r\nThe Entheogen Genome Project, in collaboration with The Entheome Foundation - working to sequence all known psychedelic fungi and plants, and to provide the data freely to all\r\n\r\nOver the next quarter we plan to:\u00a0\r\n\r\n+ Create a contributor model to enable community members to create, contribute and have a voice in DAO governance\u00a0\r\n+ Further build out the team to include industry, ethical and scientific advisors\r\n+ Solidify our business model and tokenomics model\r\n+ Establish operations and governance guardrails for the DAO\r\n+ Source cutting edge, original research projects that will advance the psychedelic space\r\n\r\nHow will these funds be used:\r\n\r\nFunding raised in the GR15 round will be used to pay for ongoing operating expenses and to\u00a0 pay key contributors to build out the infrastructure described above.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "TL;DR\r\nHere is a detailed twitter thread by @darinmandarin. and here is a tweet from @Gitcoin\r\n\r\n\r\nMRV 1O1 is a project that spun out of a founder\u2019s circle in the ReFi DAO. When it comes to safeguarding our food supply from effects of climate change, effective measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of soil regeneration, Crops\u2019 health improvement and biodiversity enhancement is critical to help small scale farmers and growers navigate tough challenges of climate change.\r\n\r\nTo help small scale projects get full benefits of carbon, ecocredits and other incentives for ecosystem services, MRV Research Group is working to publish MRV1O1, a guide to quickly understand and implement relevant MRV best practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n\r\nTraditional MRV approaches are prohibitively expensive, often constituting 30-40% of the costs for large projects over 1200 hectares. What\u2019s worse, these expenses are always upfront before generating revenue from the project. Additionally, the MRV methodologies are difficult to understand and often do not include regenerative practices valued by local communities. Data gathered during traditional MRV practices is usually kept in silos and has no useful application or benefits for smaller farmers.\r\nSmall farmers produce most of the world\u2019s food supply and they don\u2019t have any solutions to turn to Regenerative Practices. This scenario offers us a significant opportunity for regenerative impact. Additionally, Small farmers need support in switching to regenerative practices to protect their farms and livelihood from the effects of climate change.\r\n\r\nOur Solution\r\n\r\nTo publish a guide with the tools needed for small projects to conduct MRV and reap the rewards. In the guide\u2019s first edition, we are starting with agriculture, agroforestry, and small-scale farming examples.

		"description": "The purpose of ENS Spoofing Bot is to notify users that their name may have been spoofed and publish it to Forta Explorer, which allows new types of scam attacks to be detected and the damage from them minimized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem\r\n\r\nNames in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSubstitution of character pairs i\/I, i\/j, O\/0, w\/vv, m\/rn, which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;\r\nReplacing ascii characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, \u201cfa\u0441eboo\u0441k.eth\u201d uses the letters o and \u0441 from Cyrillic;\r\nUse of invisible Unicode characters;\u00a0\r\nSpoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth.\u00a0\r\n\r\nENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.\r\n\r\nThe Proposal\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to develop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering \".eth\" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.\r\n\r\nForta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community. At the moment I developed 16 bots, some of them are in the Forta Threat Detection Kit.",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7302\/taterdao-brings-accurate-real-estate-data-on-chai",
		"description": "TaterDAO is developing the legal and technical primitives to bring real estate on-chain.\r\n\r\nThis is an important problem to solve because the foundation of all sustainable efforts to reward and shape climate solutions are grounded in real estate.\r\n\r\nOffices, factories, solar farms, homes, farms, and every other real world asset touches real property (i.e. real estate). Low hanging fruit climate solutions involve LED lighting, solar power, biomass, soil capture, upgrading of HVAC systems, wind energy, etc. All of those efforts happen in or on a building, home, farm or other form of real estate.\r\n\r\nIn order to identify, create and develop climate solutions, we need to accurately identify and classify land and bring that land on-chain.\r\n\r\nAll other real estate Web3 startups need what we're building to:\r\nAccurately identify and classify real property\r\nCreate NFTs accurately representing real world property assets\r\nNesting an LLC within an NFT, to transfer ownership to property without having to change title\r\nLLCs can own the title\r\nAccurate ownership representation on NFTs allow regenerative finance operations to borrow and lend capital involving real world assets\r\nMetadata is geared specifically for real property, with location, deeds and\/or title\r\nExternal oracles will be used to monitor and manage real property climate solutions in real time.\r\n\r\nOur composable smart contracts and NFT standards enable ReFi, DeFi and climate solutions to tap into $1T worth of liquidity and unlock new business models.\r\n\r\nLand classification data is a public good necessary for the success of all climate solutions projects. Learn more on our Github at: https:\/\/github.com\/TaterDAO\/app.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy is the TaterDAO a useful and necessary solution and an integral piece of infrastructure that Climate and Refi projects can build on?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe reason that it is important for projects is that it would enable verifiable and on-chain ownership and management of real properties via DAOs.\u00a0 So, an example would be that a DAO would be able to legally own a real property and then coordinate around concrete and on-chain benchmarks that are verifiable. The metadata would allow someone to scale a climate\/refi project and provide due diligence materials to donees and\/or investors, and the external links would\/could point to external sources and perhaps oracles.\r\n\r\nAn example, might be to point directly to a soil, temperature, or water sensor that would allow the NFT to serve as a Treasury asset of a DAO, and also users, donors and other parties to wayfind the property location, deed, property boundaries, review important documentation and even review the data feed from the sensor. \u00a0 Then with real property ownership it is trivial to have a legally wrapped DAO using the NFT as the node to enter into legal agreements, which no project is immune from.\u00a0 So, with a TATR NFT a climate project could coordinate to manage DAO owned property, issue subrights, for example solar leases, or place the property into a trust that is governed by a DAO.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nProjects with climate related missions that would be natural fits to build on top of TaterDAO NFT\u2019s infrastructure are in no particular order.\r\nBasinDAO\r\nRegen Registry (issue TATR NFTs that reference the Regen Registry) and have coordinated regenerative process in a DAO ownership\r\nCharged Particles Ecology Guild - TATRs will also be capable of being charged with donations, or other ecosystem reward tokens.\r\nCarbon projects.\u00a0 This creates a snapshot, and ownership, and ability to monitor progress and milestones.\r\n\r\nAs an example to connect the dots we have this example of a Regen project on the TaterDAO arbitrum chain.\u00a0 Metadata allows:\r\nEasy access to relevant metadata fields for real estate\/refi specific fields\r\nLand classification (what is the project)\r\nLocation\r\nLegal Ownership (deed, title)\r\nTax Parcel information (verify ownership and taxes)\r\nOwnership Names\r\nKML - Easily Use Google Earth or other viewer to fly to location and review the snapshot of the property\r\nWhat we commit to build with the grant: more specific documentation on how refi projects can use Tater DAO to own NFTs and manage property. \u00a0 As an example, look at this open source research.",

I am excited and enthralled by the potential of the Lootverse and think it would make a fantastic documentary-style podcast series that has the capacity to reach a global audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough my experience as a professional journalist and podcast producer I have started two podcasting companies: Volume and Alibi Investigations. I have won 16 awards, covered all manner of subjects and worked for a large number of high-profile companies. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Lootverse presents something very special. There is potential to tell a compelling audio story (over multiple episodes) about the creation of the project and the builders. We could dig into the history of Loot, the exciting projects that continue to proliferate, like The Eye (for Adventurers)  and The Loot MMO, its capacity to expand and the future for the community going forward. \r\n\r\nProduction of the podcast would be rewarding for all involved. We would interview, write, record, edit and produce each episode of the podcast to the highest standard. \r\n\r\nInterviewing: $900\r\nEditing: $600\r\nProduction: $300\r\nVoice over: $600\r\nStudio time: $500\r\nMixing and Mastering: $400\r\nComposing original music: $200\r\nEach episode would cost $3,500 to produce. \r\n\r\nThis would include the cost of employing a documentary-style editor, composing original music and mixing and mastering each episode to a professional standard. \r\n\r\n4 documentary-style podcasting episodes would cost $14,000.

The best way we see to accomplish this mission is by establishing new education systems.\r\n\r\nIn our first step towards this goal, we are hosting \"research sessions\" viewed by a \"collective intelligence\". In the research session, a researcher records their laptop\/room\/conversation (depending on the type of research), much like Steven Wolfram does: Steven Wolfram Live Streams. The sessions are viewed by a \"collective intelligence\": anyone in the world who is excited about learning and advancing science, essentially the \"students\". It is unique because they converse online, answer each other's questions, and only once a week communicate their unanswered questions to the researcher.\r\n\r\nPrimary advantages of our proposed approach are:\r\nFree education that is accessible to anyone in the world.\r\nHigher quality research, accomplished through peer review happening during \"research sessions\".\r\nReducing teaching time: professors who don't want to be teaching do not need to be thanks to our system that relies on the professor communicating with the student's \"collective intelligence\".\r\nIntegrating research into the real world by incentivizing a decentralized team to execute on required tasks.\r\nTraining of the next generation of researchers with hands on experience from world class experts.\r\n\r\nOur primary objectives right now are onboard 3 researchers in the fields of human computer interaction, psychology and mathematics. We think these fields fit our model well and will be valuable learning experiences for this to scale. \r\n\r\nIf you are a DAO, we are also excited about working with you! Instead of a researcher, the \u201csession leader\u201d would be a leader from your DAO, and your audience would be people who want to get onboarded into your community. Giving your potentially new community members access to the brightest minds in your org, without distracting your bright minds from building.\r\n\r\nWe are excited about this model because ANYONE IN THE WORLD will have access to what world class experts on any given topic are CURRENTLY working on. Right now, only the researchers collaborators have access to this information. The public has to wait years until the research is published. Moreover, the researcher needs to exert the same amount of energy as they would with ONE graduate student, in order to get the collective intelligence of potentially thousands of individuals (Steven Wolfram has 1k-2.5k viewers for each of his live streams).\r\n\r\nThe money from this grant will allow us to pay contributors, purchase required tooling, and\r\n\r\nFind more info here.\r\n",

It is a digital token without a denomination or value. The fundamental aim of these digital assets is for new groups of people to be introduced to and familiarize themselves with blockchain technologies (for example, installing web3 wallets, understanding the publicity of the blockchain (on the example of transactions in polygonscan), etc.)\r\nAnd, of course, it is much safer to learn something new without worrying about losing something valuable. Our task is to provide with the opportunity to do this.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout the TRL Global Foundation in three minutes\u00a0PDF\r\nAbout the TRL Alliance\/Science PDF (all links in the document are working)",

Here we will focus largely on DIDKit, due to the complexity of its problem space and its applicability to a wide variety of use cases. Ultrapods aims to make a useful, open, and versatile toolkit, which drives our design of each component to be modular and just complex enough to do the heavy lifting for a wide range of use cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs more and more real-world value gets digitized over the decades, \"identity data\" has become a chokepoint for virtually all other digital value systems. Furthermore, every central repository of personal information has become a target of opportunistic business models, many of them illegal and based on exfiltration and interception of personal data. The legal spheres of so-called \"ad-tech\" and data brokerages and the illegal spheres of espionage, identity theft, and industrialized computer fraud share many characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUltrapods is an open-source, decentralized identity platform that works openly to advance these technologies in a sustainable, standards-driven way. We share the values of the community that has been driving this technology for a decade, and we want to see it succeed in the most organic and decentralized way possible. That means high standards for future-proof engineering, and an open-source strategy that keeps infrastructure and standards governance in the hands of a democratic commons.",

However, compared with unstoppable domain, ENS still have much less registration numbers (Till Aug 2022, unstoppable domain has more than 2.5 million names registered while ENS total registration number is still less than 2 million.)\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe think the key reason behind this situation is that\u00a0it is actually more difficult for new users to have one ENS name\u00a0since most of them will\u00a0encounter difficulties in acquiring Ethereum, paying gas fees and even having a wallet,\u00a0which are all essentially needed in registering an ENS name.\r\n\r\nBuy.ensdom.com is a website to help more new users to register their first ENS name without concerning about the trouble to get ETH and the lengthy time to understand the complex ENS registration process.\r\nOur mission is to\u00a0help more newcomers to join the ENS community with extreme convenience and best ENS registration experience, thus helping\u00a0to grow the ENS ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur service helps the users to buy their ENS domains in 24 hours at a fixed price in USD. Once customers try our service, we will help register their chosen ENS names instead and transfer to their wallet in 24 hours. Thus, people\u00a0will no longer have to worry about the gas fees nor having ETH. What all users have to do is to choose the ENS name they want to register, provide necessary information to us, check out through their own credit card and wait for our confirmation email that we\u2019ve actually sent your name on your wallet within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy using our service, customers can actually purchase their desired .eth names without the hassle of having their own ETH plus other fees. Even people who lack understanding and knowledge about the requirements of purchasing their own ENS name can actually have their own .eth names by using our site.\r\n\r\nWe really hope our service can\u00a0provide newcomers with best ENS user experience\u00a0and meanwhile\u00a0let more people to\u00a0discover the charm of ENS and to register one for themselves.

Founder Divya Jyoti Sen and co-founder Jade Lai-ting li started a team of 22 web experts with over 12 years of experience that can provide the best website design, development, and marketing services to grow their client\u2019s business online. Recently we have launched a new platform called Newsmartjob to provide opportunities and freelancing gigs to job seekers in the blockchain industry. Ours is the only blockchain smart contract freelance platform to ever exist. \r\n\r\nSmart contracts are digital contracts that work on certain terms and conditions to make sure whether an agreement is automatically executed or not. Official contracts like these are necessary to satisfy the freelancers and the clients that their payment and task will be completed satisfactorily.As a freelancer, it\u2019s very important to have trust and transparency with your clients. Because that is the foundation of any successful business. There are numerous platforms out there that help freelancers get good gigs and consistent work. But when it comes to payment, their process is either too slow or clients back out at the last moment.Whatever the reason, freelancers have to suffer in the end. They are overworked and denied their reward, whether intentionally or unintentionally. But this doesn\u2019t happen with Newsmartjob because we use smart contracts like MetaMask to avoid any kind of payment delay. Interestingly, we are the only ones to have this system as of now. MetaMask is a kind of smart contract or a cryptocurrency wallet that single\u0002handedly works on both desktop and mobile devices. It is popular because of its ability to buy, send and receive cryptocurrency from within the wallet. Smart contracts provide this level of security and safety among job seekers to maintain their trust. With the presence of these digital contracts, it becomes easier for freelancers to provide great value to their clients without any second thoughts. Newsmartjob accepts everyone around the globe to be a part of their platform and earn a consistent income through it. With emerging advanced technologies like these, people can trust freelancing as a legit carrier choice. \r\n\r\nJust like other jobs, freelancing has its pros and cons but one of its biggest drawbacks was denied payment. Nobody likes losing their hard-earned money. Newsmartjobs understands this pain and agony and their smart contracts act as a painkiller for the same.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us for more details.\r\n\r\nSite : https:\/\/newsmartjob.com\r\nInstagram : https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/newsmartjob\/, https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yuko.tomika\/\r\nLinkedin\u00a0: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/newsmartjob\r\nTwitter\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0: https:\/\/twitter.com\/YukoSmartJobs\r\nTelegram\u00a0: https:\/\/t.me\/looking4jobs\r\nWhatsapp\u00a0: https:\/\/wa.me\/919465957001\r\n\r\nSignup : https:\/\/newsmartjob.com?hash=37005210e23681aed354d34d981c172a\r\n",

		"description": "Abbreviations:\r\n\r\nPHS - Public Health Sciences,\r\nPH - Public Health,\r\nWHO - World Health Organization,\r\nHIV - human immunodeficiency virus,\r\nDAO - decentralized autonomous organization,\r\nMSM - men who have sex with men,\r\nDCs - decentralized blockchain-based ad hoc medical councils.\r\n\r\n#harm reduction programs - different programs, restraining the HIV transmission from risk groups to general population. Include distribution of free sterile syringes, condoms, etc.\r\n\r\nWho am I?\r\n\r\nMD, spec in infectious diseases, a researcher in Public Health, charity initiatives creator, science-inspirator (myriad of ideas ;).\r\n\r\n7-yrs experience in complex cases curation, including HIV, viral hepatitis, and COVID-19. I was one of the first specialists to describe and publish a study of prolonged (318-days) COVID-19 in a B-cell lymphoma patient (https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-750741\/v1). For the past six months, I have been involved in the UK-based Bionabu charity initiative dedicated to telemedicine consulting Ukrainian residents and refugees with infections. Having a Master's degree in Public Health Sciences, I became the author & co-author of several research papers in recognized scientific journals such as BMC Infectious diseases, Frontiers in Medicine, Health Information Science and Systems (https:\/\/scholar.google.ru\/citations?user=k7pjtEoAAAAJ&hl=ru).\r\n\r\nReasoning\r\n\r\nUsually, Public Health (PH) is considered a well-established area. However, its policies have low effectiveness despite all the efforts of official international healthcare regulators & a large number of non-profit services. In addition, the lack of widespread tradition of assessing and dynamic re-evaluation of results robs the Healthcare authorities & humanity of completed discoveries and policies. To these accidents we can attribute the famous \u201chydroxychloroquine for COVID-19\u201d case (the drug is not useful and quite harmful), or \u201canti-arrhythmic meds always save lives in infarct patients with extrasystoles\u201d (can save from acute deterioration, but increase overall mortality in this population). Talking about researching & reporting flank, we can see a scandalous inability to formulate necessary research questions in big PH-study designs and ridiculous systematic errors in collecting population-level data that negate further study results.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing competition between scientific groups for resources & journal places that are mainly allocated for the most \u201cpositive\u201d findings, combined with research centers' willingness not to lose their reputation, diminishes the capacity of PH Sciences. Hence, independent Public Health initiatives are conducted in a \"detective\" manner if we mean quality evaluations. It is unwelcome for understandable reasons.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why we are here - to create the first independent web3 social ecosystem for Public Health research proposals posting, evaluation and further transparent reporting of findings and well-annotated data (FAIR-data). It will provide an opportunity to conduct collegial motivated study designs reviewing and transparent findings-reporting with rewards for participants via specific smart-contract algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe main purposes of PH are more than the prevention of diseases and arrangement of medical help on the social scale, it is also in discovering effective mechanisms for communication and experience exchange between professionals. Modern communication technologies as well as significant demand for high-quality medical help give opportunities for decentralized blockchain-based ad hoc medical councils (DCs) and health-technology assessment (HTA). This makes it crucial to attract the attention of public health authorities to the problem of doing such key discussions faster and with more independence & incentive to participants.\r\n\r\nPHS DAO' prototype\r\n\r\nWe propose a DAO with web3 social features for public health specialists, DCs & HTA groups and groups of Social Media & Government relation groups. The community\u2019s repositories will be for different public health issues & corresponding initiatives. All of them will repeat the core repository's structure, consisting of specialists from different sub-fields of Public Health Sciences. The opportunity to \"fork\" the structure of the main repository will determine specialists' easy \"transfer\" between the main and issues-related repositories.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nMain actions in such repositories: conducting a study designs evaluation via smart-contract-based voting & rewarding of participants; fundraising campaign in cryptocurrency via DeFi principles; assessment and reevaluation of the conducting studies; creating the non-removable reporting-record. in other words, fast and transparent report of the findings, even if they are misleading - it is important for storage of discoveries with intermediate meaning and negative ones - for further fixing of population's peculiarities, biases revealing, adjusted policies creation. It is very important for thorough meta-analysis and filtering of unsuccessful hypotheses or the circumstances for their realization.\r\n\r\nThe PH measures suffer from the undesirable meeting of research intentions and redundant centralization. In it Public Health with Charity initiatives are similar. \u201cPHS DAO: Decentralized Public Health Initiatives\u201d give a birth to censor-detached and not mainstream projects but for most vulnerable populations, whose problems are too unpopular to be funded.\r\n\r\nPHS DAO' first proposed initiatives\r\n\u00a0\r\nThere are two first proposed initiatives ready to be reviewed and conducted:\r\n\u00a0\r\n1) seamless distribution of antiretroviral therapy in HIV+ refugees population (without any ID documents) with further evaluation of HIV-circulation in it and it's impact for resistant HIV transmission and AIDS epidemics progression.\r\n\u00a0\r\n2) decentralized ad hoc medical council for ethics problems in everyday medical practice - target population is medical specialists that work in circumstances of undivided responsibility (https:\/\/blog.gosh.sh\/p\/medical-ethics-and-artificial-intelligence).\r\n\r\nBoth of them, if will be realized, give not only policies for the target populations (HIV+ refugees and medical doctors), but also a meta-level estimation of HIV transmission, as well as prevalence of ethical issues in different societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7321\/ens-spoofing-bot-detect-a-scam-name-that-looks-li",
		"description": "ENS Spoofing Bot detects attacks in which someone registers a name visually similar to an existing one.\u00a0\r\n\r\nForta Protocol, which monitors blockchain events in real-time, together with this bot allows attacks to be detected before they happen or to minimize the damage from them. What's more, every ENS user will be able to receive an alert if it happened to their name. \r\n\r\nThe problem\r\n\r\nNames in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:\r\n\r\nSubstitution of character pairs i\/I, i\/j, O\/0, w\/vv, m\/rn, which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;\r\nReplacing ascii characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, \u201cfa\u0441eboo\u0441k.eth\u201d uses the letters o and \u0441 from Cyrillic;\r\nUse of invisible Unicode characters;\u00a0\r\nSpoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth.\u00a0\r\n\r\nENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.\r\n\r\nThe Proposal\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to develop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering \".eth\" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.\r\n\r\nForta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community. At the moment I developed 16 bots, some of them are in the Forta Threat Detection Kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Most attacks begin and end with the use of private services that allow funding or withdrawals without revealing the sender and recipient.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe most popular service among attackers of DeFi projects was the Tornado Cash mixer. However, after it was blocked by The US Department of Treasury, other projects will likely take over this niche. Aztec Protocol, which is a privacy-first zk-rollup on Ethereum, could be a potential such project.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Proposal\r\n\r\nTo improve attack detection in the Forta Protocol ecosystem, it is proposed to develop two separate bots covering both the account funding stage before an attack and the money laundering stage that occurs after the attack is performed.\r\n\r\nFunded Account Interaction Bot\r\nThis bot detects when an account that was funded by Aztec Connect interacts with a contract.\r\nThe severity of these findings is low, as they do not indicate malicious activity. However, in the presence of other suspicious activity, they greatly increase the accuracy of attack detection.\r\n\r\nMoney Laundering Bot\r\nThis bot detects when numerous large transfers are made to Aztec Connect, potentially indicating post-hacking money laundering activity. All user transfers are summed up within a specified time and checked for exceeding the threshold. The severity of such findings is high.\r\n\r\nThese bots will work similarly to existing bots for Tornado Cash, and I'm sure they will be able to increase the accuracy as well as the number of detected attacks.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project.

		"description": "People\u2019s Land Bank (PLB) consists of a group of passionate volunteers, and now we are looking to hire a community manager and work with experienced advisors!\r\n\r\nPLB is a UK-based meeting place, bringing together people and organisations in regenerative practice to create the right conditions for systemic change. Land is the basic platform for life; we improve access to land for regular communities.\r\n\r\nPLB\u2019S PURPOSE AND VISION\r\n\r\nPLB is a Community Interest Company that facilitates equitable, regenerative places and ways of living for the people of the UK.\r\n\r\nLand sits at the core of many social, ecological and economic issues. Effective stewardship of land will be central to sustaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and maintaining general environmental health. Local access to land will be central to food system literacy, and localised food supply chains \u2013 not to mention mental and physical health. Rising land prices are driving housing affordability crises in many places, which amplify existing inequalities, whether racial, gendered or class-based.\r\n\r\nThis is a snapshot of the context we are working in:\r\nThe UK is home to a wealth of community-led housing projects \u2013 but often groups feel like they are navigating uncharted waters. Knowledge, resource and tool sharing could and should be streamlined.\r\nMany people want to develop sustainable, affordable ways of living \u2013 but struggle to find like-minded people with which to form settlements, co-operatives or community land trusts.\r\nCommunity-led housing groups, small businesses, among others, often cite access to land as a key barrier. The price of land in the UK has skyrocketed, growing by almost 600% since the mid-90s.\r\nThose who successfully find land, they find themselves struggling with volunteer burnout due to lack of compensation for labour, or the weight of administrative and governance responsibilities.\r\n\r\nLand is more and more inaccessible, which is a huge issue as we face housing, biodiversity, and climate crises. PLB addresses this first through creating robust networks through which to learn, collaborate, and build.\r\n\r\nOur long term vision is to help realise a diverse network of decentralised regenerative settlements, with providing for their basic needs through land-based practices.\r\n\r\nConnecting communities affected by lack of access to land, and building coalitions among those who have shared values and goals, will be key in pursuing these diverse neighbourhoods. This way, we can share diverse skills, experiences, resources and privileges, in order to learn and build together.\r\n\r\nWhen more alliances are formed, we hope to develop easily replicable models for acquiring and stewarding land, with a view to developing regenerative, equitable settlements. We could connect those who want to live low-impact with landowners seeking to use their land in civically-minded ways, for instance. We want to share knowledge so that more people can learn how to navigate the opaque and daunting planning system, develop replicable pathways to acquiring and stewarding land, or experiment in democratic methods of neighbourhood governance (often known for its administrative bloat and bureaucratic burdens, thus essentially limiting participation to those who are time-wealthy).\r\n\r\nGRANT\r\n\r\nOur next step in this journey is to hire a dedicated community manager. Our online community already consists of people from all over the UK. To nourish a robust, resilient community and make the most of our networks requires more time and energy than we volunteers currently have capacity for; to be sustainable, such labour must be fairly compensated. \\\\n\\\\nAs we navigate the uncharted waters between land reform, regenerative placemaking and web3 in the UK, we will need the help of various advisors who are more experienced and knowledgeable in web3 than we are. Most of our volunteers come from the built environment and community-led housing spaces, and we will need technical and strategic support from people familiar with the UK context and the broader web3 landscape.",

I worked with Kevin Owocki (Gitcoin co-founder) on the Greatest LARP Gitcoin Fundraiser during which I made dozens of 3D models, and together we raised $500k that went to the Gitcoin Matching Pool.\r\nFor the first time, I was making meaningful art that directly raised funds for important social causes. Since then, I\u2019ve worked closely with the DAO to proliferate regen vibes across web3 while helping communities build and fund their shared needs. It\u2019s been a wonderful adventure surrounded by kind, talented, and optimistic people that inspire me every day.\r\nMy most recent adventure started by making a pledge to give 100% of my art sales to social causes. I hope to define a \u201cDegen to Regen\u201d path for more artists to join the movement and channel our collective resources into building a brighter future!",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7333\/active-blockference-an-open-source-package-for-co",
		"description": "Overview\r\nActive Blockference is an open source package that is implementing Active Inference simulations in cadCAD, with a focus on blockchain and Decentralized Science (DeSci) ecosystems. We are working to develop Active Blockference into a modern framework for cognitive systems engineering in blockchain & cyberphysical ecosystems.\r\nThe Active Inference Institute (AII) is a non-profit open-science institute curating and developing applications related to the Active Inference framework. The goal of AII is to produce cutting-edge education and research to enable real-world applications of Active Inference. AII also seeks to scaffold the Active Inference community: increasing the competency of participants & raising broader awareness of these topics.\r\nAs the DeSci ecosystem rapidly expands, it will become increasingly important have historical, real-time, and anticipatory awareness for researchers and organizations. This kind of situational awareness will be vital for maintaining public goods such as Science, Education, and social Communities. In this grant we are aiming to operationalize our Active Entity Ontology for Science (AEOS), through the use of the Active Blockference open source package, to enable this kind of modeling.\r\nActive Inference is an approach to modeling cognitive entities which is being applied to many fields ranging from artificial intelligence to communication, trust, and collective intelligence, and regenerative finance. We are building Active Blockference to be a simulation and design package that uses cadCAD to implement Active Inference (ActInf). Briefly summarizing, ActInf agents act to minimize their uncertainty about the world though sensemaking and action, reducing the divergence between their predictions and observations.\r\nResources to learn more:\r\n200+ Livestreams covering many Active Inference papers and topics\r\nActive Blockference presenting on the cadCAD community call from August 3, 2022\r\nActive Blockference presenting on the SCRF community call from August 25, 2022\r\n\r\nWhere is the project and team currently at?\r\nCurrently, several working Active Blockference simulation notebooks are available, and our all-volunteer project team meets twice weekly. We have been in development on this project specifically for around 1 year, and the Institute has been in operation since the beginning of 2021. We are seeking resources to increase the pace of development, scaffold partnerships, and acquire computational resources.\r\nThis project is scaffolded and stewarded by the Active Inference Institute (https:\/\/www.activeinference.org\/). We are an international team of distributed researchers (currently active contributors to the project include: Jakub, Bleu, Janna, Daniel, Brock, Sidcode, Amit, Shady, Peter, and more.\r\nWe are working closely with the cadCAD development team, and using their platform BlockScienceLabs. Additionally we are connected\/collaborating with several relevant groups in Web3 (such as Kernel Community), the DeSci space such as OpSci (via project participants Jakub and Shady).\r\nWe have been interested to apply Active Inference to the setting of Web3, DeFi, and Decentralized Science (DeSci) for some time now, resulting in our paper from March 2022: \u201cAn Active Inference Ontology for Decentralized Science: from Situated Sensemaking to the Epistemic Commons\u201c. In this paper we provided an overview and contextualization of Decentralized Science, and introduced the AEOS framework which this grant will develop upon.\r\nCurrently, Active Blockference simulates the cognitive processes and goal-directed behavior of a single-agent. Our goal is to expand this simulation into a multi-agent model, in order to explore the cognition and behavior that drive successful DeSci and DeFi projects. As a multi-agent simulation, Active Blockference would facilitate the rigorous analysis of consensus protocols and Web3 communities prior to deployment. It can serve as a sandbox where we explore the cognitive, micro-economic, behavioral, and decision-making processes of DeFi.\u00a0Hence, we aim to develop the tooling, use cases (case studies), and educational resources that enable a cognitive audit of DeFi protocols in Web3. The addition of this cognitive layer into the DeFi development stack will facilitate trust in DeFi protocols within the Ethereum community, thus maximizing the value of these projects.\r\n\r\nWhat are the next steps for Active Blockference?\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecify the entity types that are involved in DeSci using AEOS\r\nCreate Active Blockference entity models in cadCAD\r\nCompose simulation environments based upon specific use cases\r\nDo parameter sweeps in cadCAD across system and cognitive parameters\r\n???????????????????????????\r\nHave an epistemic commons that works for everybody\r\n\r\nThis grant we will have 3 main aims and\u00a0areas of output.\r\nDevelop the Active Blockference package to address the blockchain setting with a focus on the social and technical aspects of DeSci ecosystems.\r\nUse Active Blockference to understand behavior within ETH\/Web3 ecosystems, including DeSci and DeFi. Here we will complement existing cadCAD simulations and case studies\r\nImprove educational materials, documentation, and public communications (e.g. blog posts) to onboard new people to the Active Blockference community. This will included Low\/No Code application running Active Blockference\r\n\r\nWhat would success look like for Active Blockference?\r\nProviding a library\/package anyone can build on top of with software affordances (like Git), to enable cognitive modeling & cognitive auditing of epistemic ecosystems in DeSci and beyond.\r\n\r\nHow does this project benefit the greater Ethereum ecosystem?\r\nThe ETH ecosystem is challenged by projects that fail to realize their expectations, due to insufficient consideration of the cognition & behavior of people using them. This can look like the failure of communities\/protocols to persist for various reasons, here we are most interested in the behavioral aspects of these phenomena. The Active Blockference package and framework will facilitate rigorous cognitive audits of Economic protocols, epistemic ecosystems (as in DeSci), as well as Web3 communities, during design time and run-time (realtime tools for adaptive organizations).\r\nImplementing Active Blockference within the ETH ecosystem will add value, and scaffold community cohesion in several ways:\r\nWe have advanced structural and macroeconomic models for Ethereum in cadCAD. However, there are no entity models for ETH, limiting the usage of behavioral and microeconomic models. These types of entity models could complement structural models, for example by enabling better understanding of the behavioral aspects of cryptoeconomic systems, fostering healthy interactions, planning with foresight, and applying of corrective interventions\r\nWhile ETH mainnet transactions are transparent for all, explainability is not. Active Blockference will contribute towards explainability via interpretable visualizations, natural language descriptions, and useful simulations.\r\nETH elaborations: ETH infrastructure is undergoing rapid development and deployment, Layer 2\u2019s, ZK rollups, and other innovations position the ecosystem in a constant state of change that can benefit from the ActInf approaches inherent principles and sensitivities working with cognitive agents acting under uncertainty.\r\nCognitive Security in ETH: Cognitive auditing \u2014 Beyond today\u2019s smart contract auditing (inferring situated, motivated outcomes).\r\nThe implementation of an Active Entity Ontology in cadCAD will provide the ETH community with a working model of active and informational agents as well as their affordances (e.g. a smart contract is an informational agent with predefined affordances).\r\nThe accessibility of on- and off-chain systems will be facilitated via open source Active Blockference models of cognitive-behavioral systems, permitting validation of ETH protocols using no\/low-code simulations.\r\nAn open source software package that connects ETH on- and off-chain activity and packages already in use (such as cadCAD) to broader currents related to Cognitive Science. This connection could enable algorithmic project \u201ccognitive audits\u201d to maximize the value of projects deployed on Ethereum. For example currently, smart contracts are statically audited for security (e.g. unintended interactions within\/among contracts).\u00a0With Active Blockference it would be possible simulate a testnet blockchain environment, where smart contracts usage is evaluated as interacting with dynamic cognitive agents. This could result in fewer projects that are viable from a \u201csmart contract security\u201d perspective but\u00a0unviable from a behavioral perspective.\r\n\r\nWhat is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\r\n\r\nWe are un-boxing DeSci collaborations through ontology-driven applications of cognitive science and organizational design. Researchers would know what ropes to climb, in order to contribute and succeed in terms of implicit goals.\r\nActive Inference centers the role of intrinsic motivation (motivators such as curiosity and learning, as opposed to extrinisic motivators such as tokens), a crucial factor for DeSci.\r\nOur work will be a solution which can templatized and inherited upon to adapt to different team settings. We are building tools for many kinds of organizations in the ETH ecosystem, not only scaffolding our own work.\r\nUsing Active Blockference, we are developing a new open source approach for modeling, evaluating, and designing DeFi \/ DeSci \/ Web3 community protocols. The framework of Active Inference will facilitate the cognitive modeling of Web3 system dynamics (individual and collective behavior, funding, treasuries, protocols, etc.) as well as the general Ethereum consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nMore details will be added to this grant in the days to come!\r\n\r\nThank you for the consideration & support.",

If he was born in the 21st century, there's doubt such a theory would've been created.\r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\nGovernment grants --the main way that research is funded-- suck at funding and realizing neurotech research into products. The current process to get grants is slow, bureaucratic, fragmented and can take up to 50% of a professor\u2019s time. As a result, neurotech lags behind typical innovation and commercialization in biotech. Additionally, you must repeatedly apply for grants every 2-5 years leading to short-sighted research.\r\n\r\nLess than 10% of data collected by publicly funded research in the US is published alongside their papers. An average of 70% of researchers have failed to replicate their colleagues\u2019 work across disciplines. - OpSci\r\n\r\nThis issue drastically affects the neurotech space as there is a scarcity of high-quality data for research. In addition, the current structures in academia deters researchers from sharing their data due to a lack of incentives or security. Even when data is shared, it is not guaranteed to be useful.\r\n\r\nPutting these two issues together, it\u2019s difficult for any revolutionary scientific progress to be achieved in this academic ecosystem.\r\nThere isn\u2019t a question of how many Einsteins there are in the world. The question is How many Einsteins are lost in the current world of academia\r\n\r\nAt NeuraDAO, we want to support talented researchers who are doing work in neurotech that will change the world. We do this by creating incentives to create and share high-quality data (via the NeuraDAO data marketplace), as well as creating more sustainable funding models for researchers. We hope our support will go towards creating long-term research and much-needed tooling, as well as bringing more accessibility and interoperability to neurotech data.\r\nWe also plan to support the DeSci ecosystem by funding conferences, and \u201chacker houses\u201d such as the potential NeuraHouse in ETHLisbon 2022.\r\n\r\nThe NeuraCore & Our Progress\r\n\r\nWho we are, alphabetically:\r\n\r\nAhnaaf Khan: https:\/\/twitter.com\/ahnaaf_khan_\r\nAmy Nick: https:\/\/twitter.com\/amynickSN_\r\nAnush Mutyala: https:\/\/twitter.com\/anushmutyala\r\nChristian Graves https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xbrekolazh\r\nIn\u00eas Pereira: https:\/\/twitter.com\/nespereira_\r\nNicolas Singh: https:\/\/twitter.com\/nicholassinghh\r\n\r\nWhere we stand and where we want to go\r\n\r\n\u2705 Done:\r\n- Mission defined\r\n- Core team assembled\r\n- Onboard on 30+ Neurotech researchers\r\n- Community building\r\n- Deployed marketplace on Rinkeby\r\n\r\n\u25b6\ufe0f Next milestones:\r\n- Launch our marketplace on mainnet\r\n- Legal Instantiation\r\n- Team growth (working groups)\r\n\r\nHow we will use the funds:\r\n- Support the creation of the NeuraDAO marketplace.\r\n- Support the operations for NeuraHouse",

We find, spotlight, and fund technological and other strategic infrastructure to help scientists and researchers solve some of the world's most pressing problems, with an emphasis on engaging the public. We seek to make long-lasting changes to the way science is produced and communicated so that it is more open, more democratic, and more optimized to benefit the public.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Current Actions, Supported Projects, and Expected Use of Donations\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe SCI currently supports development behind two user-complete projects and their communities while also supporting the advancement of the DeSci ecosystem at large.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDeSci Ecosystem\r\nThe DeSci movement is using novel technology to build tools for the scientific system. These tools will remove inefficiencies, redefine incentives, and reimagine what access means. Beyond all that, The SCI believes that the DeSci movement and the tools it is building are critical for rebuilding the bridge of trust between science and the public.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe believe strongly that a connected DeSci is a stronger DeSci. We hope to continue building a project-agnostic, permissionless, and free infrastructure on which the DeSci ecosystem can rely for support. In addition to our currently supported DeSci initiatives, with your help we hope to grow to support events and freelance development in the DeSci space while developing avenues of outreach and education for people new to web3, DeSci, and who want to use DeSci to get involved with the scientific system.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDeSci Weekly Roundups\r\nOur Weekly DeSci Roundups connect DeSci projects and their communities to one another.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDeSci Community Resources Repo\r\nWe have launched and continue to develop a project-agnostic GitHub repo of DeSci resources. Projects, publications, and other resources can be added through issues, pull requests, or discussions on our Discord server. Conversations on potential additions or edits take place in public on the repo. We hope to build out repo maintenance infrastructure to include people not associated with The SCI.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDiscord Notification Aggregation and Curation Service\r\nOur Discord server offers a curated announcements channel. We join all the DeSci Discord servers we find, create a listening channel for their announcements, and curate high priority, critical announcements into our announcements channel. The DeSci community is welcome to leave notifications for that channel on and be confident that they will not have their wedding interrupted for an announcement about a community call. This way the community can stay up to date on the general development of the entire DeSci ecosystem without having to be involved or socially invested in every project.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBounty Board\r\nWe intend to incorporate DeSci bounties on our bounty board.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe look forward to supporting DeSci initiatives such as conferences and funding rounds as we further establish ourselves as a viable non-profit in the DeSci ecosystem.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDeSci Weekly Roundups\r\nDeSci Community Resources\r\nDiscord Notification Aggregation and Curation Service\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing (BOINC)\r\nBOINC is the first highly successful permissionless distributed computing platform. It was developed out of SETI@Home in 1999. In many ways, it is the embodiment of DeSci.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo date, BOINC has been the driving force behind numerous computationally intensive research programs; There have been over 400 scientific papers published using results from BOINC projects. Some notable achievements include producing an accurate 3D model of SARS-CoV-2 before crystallization-based models (Rosetta@home), developing a manufactured and distributed COVID-19 vaccine (Rosetta@home), finding new subatomic particles (LHC@Home), identifying pulsars (Einstein@Home), advancements in cancer marker and treatment research (World Community Grid), simulation of candidate molecules for next-generation solar panels (World Community Grid), advancements in climate research (ClimatePrediction.Net), along with many, many others.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBOINC ties the public to science, in part, by enabling any individual to create a distributed computing project for the cost of a server, which can be as simple as a personal laptop running in their garage. The public chooses to engage with the project, learn about the science, and participate. While BOINC is used by countless science enthusiasts, many of the large projects are supported by institutions such as universities from around the world, CERN, Krembil Research Institute, and the Max Planck Institute.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBOINC Radio Podcast\r\nThe BOINC Radio has been hosting a BOINC oriented podcast for over two years! The discussions range from the greater implications of distributed computing, to BOINC specific architecture, to development hopes and dreams, to informal chats about various beverages. A weekly beacon for the community, the BOINC radio gives anyone who wants a place to share their BOINC story, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any end in sight.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Project briefs\r\nThe Project briefs are a spinoff from the BOINC Radio Podcast. They are detailed, yet palatable, explanations of BOINC projects, their science, and how to contribute. With over two dozen episodes recorded so far, the Project briefs will undoubtedly need new projects to spin up to keep going! Or maybe they can dig into the hundreds of projects from BOINC\u2019s past\u2026\r\n\u00a0\r\nBounty Board\r\nThe SCI currently hosts bounties for the BOINC community and development team.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe SCI hopes to further accelerate BOINC development and adoption by funding bounties, helping new distributed computing projects spin up their servers and connect their applications, and spreading education on the platform to institutions and enthusiasts far and wide.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBOINC Radio Podcast and The Project briefs - Or wherever you get your podcasts\r\nBounty Board\r\n\u00a0\r\nLearn More About BOINC\r\nBOINC GitHub\r\n\u00a0\r\nGridcoin\r\nDeveloped during the second altcoin explosion as the first PoW bootstrapped coin to transition to PoS (2013) and the first entirely science-based blockchain and Open Economic Network, Gridcoin is an open-source multi-incentive permissionless blockchain that mints and distributes cryptocurrency to various contribution-based and point-accruing systems. It currently distributes currency according to the relative processing power a network participant directs toward data-driven analysis and scientific discovery across BOINC.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe SCI hopes to support the Gridcoin community in its quest to use distributed ledger technology and economics to bring science to everyone, and everyone to science. Its main incentive structure encourages researchers to educate the public as to the value and methods of their research while encouraging the public to seek out information on the research itself.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe SCI believes that expanding and supporting the blockchain and economic protocol behind Gridcoin will serve to establish a resilient and persistent connection between science and the public.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBounty Board\r\nThe SCI currently hosts bounties for the Gridcoin community and development team.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe SCI hopes to further accelerate Gridcoin development and adoption by funding bounties, helping Gridcoin incorporate new point-accruing systems into its incentive layer, and, among other things, by providing a vehicle for formal representation throughout the DLT industry.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nBounty Board\r\n\u00a0\r\nSome stats:\r\n3,400 unique staking nodes (2019)\r\n7th of all blockchain projects as of Feb 2021\r\n16,000 active contributors to distributed computing projects\r\n18 incentivized BOINC projects\r\nManual Reward Claims (MRC) (Aug 2022), which is a form of delegated staking by request, makes Gridcoin the first effectively no-cost entry PoS blockchain.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCod.cloud presentation\r\nLearn More About Gridcoin\r\nMore Gridcoin Resources\r\nGridcoin GitHub\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nExpected Use of Donations\r\nThe SCI has established a bounty board and intends to use a portion of the donations from GR15 to develop it to include bounties for all currently supported projects. Donations will also be directed toward community growth initiatives for all currently supported projects. Additionally and if possible, donations will be used to increase the number of projects The SCI supports. There are already a few projects we have our eyes on and we would love to develop the infrastructure to support them through bounties and community initiatives. Finally, donations will be used to cover general expenses incurred by operating a 501c3, such as web hosting, legal fees, accounting, etc. No board members or officers in The SCI receive pay for their work.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe SCI Board Members\r\n\u00a0\r\nJames Owens - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jamescowens\u00a0\r\nMarcus Belcastro - https:\/\/au.linkedin.com\/in\/marcus-belcastro-96628a1a1\u00a0\r\nLevi Rybalov - https:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/levi-rybalov\/\r\nVitalii Koshura - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/aenbleidd\/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWarren Lucas - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/warren-lucas-23264971\/\u00a0\r\nPaul W.

Not all universities have the resources to support these teams, which unfortunately leaves many students without access to the competition.\r\n\r\nOpening access\r\nLabDAO aims to launch a decentralized iGEM team to allow students from anywhere in the world to come together online and compete, regardless of their geographic or economic circumstances.\r\n\r\nTalented students will be invited to join this global team, where they will have access to experienced mentors and resources needed to invent new synthetic biology applications. \r\n\r\nHow will funds be used?\r\nFunds raised by this Gitcoin grant will cover registration costs, laboratory expenses, and will help send team members to the 2023 iGEM International Jamboree to present their work in person. This unique experience will give the scholars a chance to develop a professional network in their field, practice their science communication skills, and celebrate their achievements.\r\n\r\nWith any additional funding LabDAO hopes to support students who could not otherwise commit to the project full-time during the summer for financial reasons. True decentralization means creating opportunities for everyone.\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Impacta Finance was created to scale web3 impact organizations through an index to evaluate and monetize digital assets that have a significant positive impact on people, communities, and the environment.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe are building tools to boost liquidity, coordination, and confidence in the Regenerative Finance market, with a focus on tokens designed to back real natural assets and projects that promote positive solutions using web3 tools.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nProblems \ud83d\udea9\r\nDespite the growing interest in metaverses, NFTs, and fungible assets, as well as impact solutions that are becoming increasingly successful, it remains extremely frustrating to browse, purchase and undertake the intersection between web3 and the ESG sectors.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe biggest problems are mainly related to:\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe difficulty of interacting with decentralized finance solutions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMissing and overloaded information and the inability to find assets, stocks, and relevant content on web3 and ESG.\r\n\r\nLack of interest and liquidity from the crypto crowd for impact tokens and web3 solutions.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt is time-consuming, frustrating, and incomprehensible for those who are not living in both sectors.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSolutions \ud83d\udca1\r\nImpacta was designed to scale both web3 and ESG sectors, reducing entry barriers for investors and entrepreneurs interested in innovative decentralized impact solutions.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe want to tackle these problems by providing an impactful web3 knowledge and entertainment hub and an instrument for direct exposure to the sector.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe index was created to scale investment opportunities and the liquidity of projects that have the potential to transform the world for the better.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe 3 goals \u267b\ufe0f\r\n\u00a0\r\nAccelerate impact: accelerate projects promoting a positive impact on the web3, providing networking, solutions, and access to human and capital.\r\n\r\nIncrease Adoption: expand the exposure and liquidity of impact initiatives, increasing adoption of this asset class to transform them into a top leader class.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMake impact hype: through communities, memes, colors, and entertainment, we want to make impact fun again.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat are we doing? \ud83c\udf0e\r\nImpacta is focused on 4 action fronts to scale web3 impact initiatives:\r\n\u00a0\r\n1. Mapping: Through the Impact & Web3 Database, built collaboratively with other DAOs, we map in a continuous, structured, and unified way, the existing bases on impact and web3 with a unitary taxonomy.\r\n\r\n2. Scoring & Tracking: Development of a methodology, created for both users with no prior knowledge and crypto natives, so that they can learn in real-time about the most promising initiatives in the sector, through a scoring that takes into account numerous variables, such as security, innovation, liquidity, impact, and financial return.\r\n\r\n3. Exposure & aggregate tools: We focus on assets that hold real value such as Carbon, Water, Renewable Energy, and Recycling Certificates, among other nature-backed digital assets and tokens with real impact use cases. We want to create the ground for additional DeFi instruments for impact tokens such as ETFs, futures, and other derivatives, in order to scale their impact, capitalization, and adoption.\r\n\r\n4. Web3 transition: Drive the digital transition and scale operational and early-stage organizations that are already solving real-world problems, with a strong focus on real assets, such as forests, water, food, electronic waste, and solutions for global problems, such as erosion of sociability, financial segregation, and obesity.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat we have been working on \ud83c\udfd7\r\n1. Mapping\r\nCollaborative database to map web3 projects, currencies, and initiatives with positive impact. The Impact & Web3 Directory is built collaboratively and has a detailed, and structured taxonomy.\r\n\u00a0\r\nImpact & Web3 Directory: We have joined forces with ReFi DAO to curate an open database of web3 projects that exist to create an impact on people and the planet. We have combined datasets across different organizations involved to create a unified database that will act as a public good for the space. We currently have over 400 unique projects in this database.\r\n\r\nBuilding with ReFi DAO, @aleborda, @climateXcrypto, @cyrusofeden, @merlinwizz\r\n\u00a0\r\n2- Scoring & Tracking\r\nDevelopment of a methodology, created for both users with no prior knowledge and crypto natives, so that they can learn in real-time about the most promising initiatives in the sector, through a scoring that takes into account numerous variables, such as security, innovation, liquidity, impact certificates, and performance.\r\n\u00a0\r\nReFi Rate-Athon: A rating event in partnership with Prime DAO, and ReFi DAO to help build trust in the ReFi space and encourage capital to flow to high-integrity projects. By creating an open framework for evaluation and rewarding researchers for their analysis\u2014we built an MVP of a curated list of verified ReFi projects so that founders, talent, and investors can make sense of where to invest their time, energy, and capital.\r\n\r\nBuilding with Prime Ratings, PrimeDAO, ReFi DAO\r\n\u00a0\r\n3- Exposure & aggregate tools\r\nAllow access and exposition to the already curated base and tokens that live on different blockchains, in a simple, fun, and memetic way.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPositive Index: The Positive Index is an Open Source index that measures the positive impact of crypto assets and their performance to increase the exposure of an index that will rank companies in terms of their initiatives related to the environment, and governance (ESG), based on specific impact parameters.\r\n\r\nBuilding with 2TM, Mercado Bitcoin, Nossa Terra Firme, Idesam\r\n\u00a0\r\n4- Web3 transition\r\nDrive the web3 transition to achieve scalability of operational and early-stage organizations that are already solving real-world problems, with a strong focus on real assets, such as forests, water, food, and electronic waste, and global problems, such as erosion of sociability, financial inclusion, and obesity.\r\n\u00a0\r\nImpacta Podcast: Impacta Podcast is focused on exploring real impact use cases that are scaling through web3 tooling and technologies. We publish content especially in Portuguese, as we feel the gap between the Brazilian audience in the ReFi and positive impact spaces inside crypto. One of our main goals with the content we produce is to engage, increase participation, and invite the Latin American crowd to the impact revolution.\r\n\r\nBuilding with Gaia Greentech, Barterchain, Celo Foundation\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe believe that ROI and positive impact can be in symbiosis and that nothing will be more valuable than the assets that allow a good existence on earth.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHelp us to keep making impact hype.\r\nPlanet and people, WAGMI! \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude80",

		"description": "The U.S. Treasury's designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts, the first time software has been sanctioned, has viscerally demonstrated the impact that nation-states will have on the future of DeFi development and use. DeFi has immense potential to promote human flourishing, but that potential can only be fully realized with buy in from governments. We're working to make that happen.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe DeFi Education Fund is a nonpartisan education and advocacy group working to explain the benefits of DeFi, achieve regulatory clarity for its developers and users, and help realize the transformative potential of DeFi for everyone. Learn more about our work on our website, twitter, and substack.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTornado Cash Smart Contracts Sanctioning Efforts\r\n\u00a0\r\nTreasury's sanctioning of\u00a0 smart contracts\u2014software programs\u2014is the most significant policy action in crypto's history. While sanctions are intended to incentivize change in non-US persons' behavior, immutable smart contracts cannot be altered. Thus, the practical effect of the designations was to prohibit U.S. persons from using TC smart contracts. But, as we've all learned over the last few weeks, the downstream consequences already have grown significantly beyond that and may yet continue to.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat we've done so far:\r\nThe day after the designations, we submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Treasury to help shed light on the sanctions action.\r\nSince the arrest of TC developer Alexey Pertsev in the Netherlands, we've been trying to found out whether it's related to the sanctions designation and gotten some very troubling new information and responses from the Dutch government in response (charges and relation to sanctions still unknown).\u00a0\r\nWorked to keep the community updated with what we know.\r\nShared our perspective with Congressional offices on the situation and the inappropriateness of using sanctions authorities to ban US citizens from engaging in certain activities.\r\nMade the case in traditional media outlets, including the WSJ, NYT, Time, Cybersecurity DIVE, Decrypt 1, Decrypt 2, Coindesk, and The Information.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nOur plan going forward:\r\n\u00a0\r\nMitigate: We\u2019re petitioning Treasury to issue \u201cgeneral licenses\u201d that would allow US persons to engage in activities otherwise prohibited by the designation of the Tornado Cash smart contracts. Often when Treasury designates an entity, it\u2019ll concurrently issue a \u201cgeneral license\u201d to allow for US persons to \u201cwind down\u201d their activities and relationships with newly designated persons, entities, and (in this instance) so-called entities. For example, when Treasury designates a foreign financial institution, it can issue a general license for US persons to withdraw their assets and cease interacting with that financial institution for a period of time. A general license in this case could allow lawful US persons to, among other activities, withdraw their assets from TC smart contracts without breaching sanctions obligations. We (and many others) are also urging Treasury to issue guidance and FAQs with respect to the many outstanding and critical questions that are previewed above.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdvocate: We need to convince Treasury (and other governments) that sanctioning, restricting, or targeting the use of open-source software (and potentially those who write and publish open-source software) isn\u2019t the best way to accomplish their policy objectives and isn\u2019t in the US national interest on net. While the legal basis of the sanctions in this instance relies on considering non-persons\/non-entities (software programs) as persons\/entities, the government has a vast array of related and unrelated authorities that it could tap to effectuate a substantively similar outcome. The only thing certain is that we don't want to find out. The damage already caused by this situation has been consequential, and it\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interest for something akin to this action to happen again.\r\n\u00a0\r\nLitigate?: Our friends at Coin Center have laid out why they believe the designation of a non-person\/non-entity may be beyond the authority OFAC based its action on and may be unconstitutional.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nMore information and FAQs here on the Tornado Cash sanctions.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf you have questions about the TC designations, our work, DeFi policy developments, etc., please reach out.

By granting professional opportunities to the LGBTQIA+ community and effectively kickstarting careers, we are tapping into its largely unexplored, creative potential.\r\n\r\nWe believe diversification of culture is essential to the future of crypto because, by the nature of decentralisation, blockchain is meant to be all-inclusive.

On top of community outreach our other mission is to release products as a DAO; starting with raze.money, a decentralised fundraising platform for social causes that rewards financial contributors with impact certificates.\r\n\r\nRight now, raze.money is in its infancy and we are in search of funding to expand our team and sustain development. When you contribute liquidity to this organisation, you are granting the necessary runway for L3GENDARY to fund a network of internal, splinter DAOs that act as independent & agile teams. These DAOs as well as their budgets, are proposed, voted on, and operated by our trusted community leaders.\r\n\r\nWe are painting a vibrant future for Web3, laying the infrastructure of tomorrow, & being the agents of change we wish to see.

In reality, we find that many groups tdon't work outdue to a lack of experience in running the programs,which is a pity.And various projects are like isolate islands, and girls willing to contribute cannot find the right projects and partners.\r\nTherefore, an inclusive platform that connects people with projects is extremely valuable.\r\nAnd Web3 is a great opportunity. If there is a decentralized community that gathers projects that help women, and people who interested in this ,and the community shares the experience of the projects that have sunk in, and runs the community infrastructure so that people are not distracted by running a community, so that they can devote themselves to the projects they love.\r\nWe firmly believe that when girls band together, not only do the people being helped change and benefit, but both contributors and participants gain significant power.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve done so far:\r\nWe only started in July, and although we are small in number, we have already started to do what we can to prepare and build up the community to help\r\nChannels for Women\r\nWeekly-Presentation Project\r\nWomen's Book Club\r\nFeminist Podcast Topics\r\nDiscord bot development\r\nCommunity Events\r\nMindful Gym\r\nGroups of Interest\r\nStargazer\r\nWomen's Workplace Support: support\r\nCloud Movie Event\r\nMore programs and interest groups are waiting to be unlocked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future of Hypatia Galaxy\r\nAs a public service DAO,We hope that Hypatia Galaxy will run for a long time, regardless of who leads it, and that we can be proud of that.\r\nWhere we are headed next\r\nExpand social media operations to increase public exposure and attract more contributors.\r\nProactively reach out to platforms with projects.\r\nEnhance public community programs such as podcasts, libraries and book clubs, spiritual fitness gyms.\r\nGain practical experience in project and community governance.\r\n\r\nHypatia Grant\r\nOperating costs: future costs for basic operations such as official website servers, volunteer compensation, and so on.\r\nIf sufficient funds are available, we may be able to qualify potential community projects.

Pods offer users a clean and easy-to-use UI to create and approve proposals within a small working group and allow DAOs to create organizational structure. From users\u2019 perspective, Pod is a clean an easy-to-use interface for multi-sigs. Under the hood, a Pod is a Gnosis Safe with a light governance wrapper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArronia\u2019s Pods help solve the issues of DAOs being either decentralized or organized, but not both at once. Pods\/working groups help organize otherwise sprawling DAOs, enabling them to maximize member contributions and leverage member expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArronia enables DAOs to create small working groups based on expertise. Pod membership is represented with ERC-1155 tokens. Therefore, membership is non-fungible and can be made non-transferable ( to unqualified addresses).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPods can set custom rules to determine membership. They can be gated through hand-selecting trustworthy community members, various token staking requirements, or other methods and metrics.\r\n\r\nPods are modular, so they can be created to fit the specific needs of each unique DAO. They can also interoperate or work independently, and attach or detach from each other in a lego-like build.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\n1.Website:\u00a0https:\/\/www.arronia.club\/\r\n\r\n2.Twitter:\u00a0https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArroniaLabs\r\n\r\n3.Github:\u00a0https:\/\/github.com\/Arronia",

The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning keys, and activating switches.\r\n\r\nFuture RoadMap\r\nAdding More Levels:-\u00a0\u00a0There are only two levels of Gameplay available to Play. We need at least 20-25 levels of Gameplay to make it engaging for players to play. We also need soundtracks to be included in the Game. The following genre of Games are needed to be included in the Game:-\r\n Optical Illusion\r\n Physics-Based Puzzle (Finding Clue, sliding Puzzle, Combination Puzzle, Match3, jigsaw\r\n Board game (Hitman Go)\r\n Shooting game\r\n Fighter game\\n-Action game\r\n NFT Card battle game\r\n City Builder (construct building, gather resources defense kingdom)\r\n Tower defense\r\n Turn-Based game\r\n RPG adventure and many more genres of Games.\r\nBuilding Better Open World:-This game needs a bigger Open world that can be explored during Gameplay. Interactive elements can be placed inside the Open world which makes them more immersive.\r\n\u00a0Better Integration of NFT:-\u00a0Players have an Open World that they can explore. Puzzles are placed inside the Open-World which when solved, move Players to the next level of Metaverse(New World to explore). When players Solved the Puzzle, they mint an NFT with HitPoints, AttackDamage, and ShieldPoints. These NFTs can be Upgraded, bred, and battle with each other inside the Game.\r\nPlayers can also purchase Virtual land and in-game Assets as NFTs and Use them as assets to build any genre of Game.\r\nReal-Time Card Battle System:-\u00a0Inside the Game NFTs can be minted, upgraded, and bred. Players can play the Card battle with each other. The winner can earn NFTs and Points, which can be used to upgrade or bred(Combining two NFTs to mint a new Powerful NFT).\r\nNFT and NFT Game MarketPlace:-NFT and NFT Game Marketplace:-\u00a0We need a Marketplace where Creators can buy, sell and trade NFTs, NFTs Games, Virtual Land, Open-world, and in-game Assets. Users can rate and review the NFTs, which will improve purchasing decision process and Sales.\r\n\r\nBuild Voxel Game Maker\r\nThis is the most difficult part of this Game Platform. Creators can use Assets and available scripts to build the Game. It will need 1.5-2 months to finish the Game-Maker..\r\nTemplates of Open World and Puzzles will be available to customize according to the Player's needs. They can also import Voxel Assets from any voxel editor or the web and then use them to make the Open World of their Choice. They can sell them as NFT on Marketplace and monetize them.\r\nTo build different types of Games, Scripts will be needed. For Players with no technical knowledge, there will be several Templates of different genres of Games with scripts, that will be available for modification and combination. With these templates available inside the Game Maker, Players can Change the variable parameters of the script or Add multiple instances of the same template\/script to make complex Games.\r\nUsers can combine different Templates\/scripts to make Innovative Games inside the Metaverse and monetize them in the Marketplace.\r\nVisual Editor (similar to Unity Bolt)\u00a0for a game where the User uses visual scripting like Powerful flow control graphs (similar to Unreal Blueprints) for low-level logic and complex tasks. Elegant finite state machines (FSM) for high-level logic and easy state management. Create and modify entire graphs while in Play mode.\r\nThe Game-Maker will be a downloadable native application (Mac, Windows, Linux). A web application can be created for building Mini Games but to make Big Game Native application needs to be downloaded. So we will have a Web version of Game Maker for Mini Game and a Desktop Application for Big Game. Players can Rate and Review these Games according to their Liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nNFT GAME Marketplace\r\nThe Rating and Review system needs to be added. It will take 10-15 days to finish it\r\n1- The NFT Game Marketplace is an NFT marketplace where you can search and buy creator's ASSETS with Token to incorporate them into your Game.\r\n2- The creator can build games with different assets and templates and monetize them by listing them in the Marketplace.\r\n3- The creator can list both the Assets and Games in the NFT Marketplace and Monetize them according to their Ratings.\r\n4- The Game in the NFT Marketplace can be organized according to their Ratings and Reviews.",

We offer three different services, to help in different onboarding stages:\r\nENS Domain Registration Turnkey solution  \r\nENS Buyer's Brokerage Service\r\nENS Consultation Session\r\n\r\nWhy these services?\r\nI've been hanging around with the ENS community for almost 2 years now and I noticed that newcomers to this space are faced with multiple barriers or friction points so I decided to offer 3 different services to ease the onboarding process for them. Our Services:\r\n\r\nENS Registration\r\nI've seen many individuals and businesses that don't have the knowledge, scared to do it themselves or simply don't want to deal with the blockchain, that's where this turnkey service comes in. We give them 1 full hour of educational session about ENS basics and how to handle and maintain the domain, then we register their desired domain for them, fill out the records and deliver it safely to their wallet with zero hassle from their side.\r\n\r\nENS Buyer's Brokerage\r\nWith the exponential growth of ENS adoption, especially in the past 12 months, many individuals and businesses cannot find their desired domains as they're already taken. With this Brokerage Service we help them by reaching out to the current owner of the domain in various ways, see if they're willing to sell it, we handle all the negotiations and only when we get to an agreement we take a small commission of the final sale. Then we fill out the records and deliver the domain safely to their wallet with zero hassle from their side.\r\nWith this service, we also give them 1 full hour of educational session about ENS basics and how to handle and maintain their domain.\r\n\r\nENS Hourly Consultation Sessions\r\nMany people want to learn more about ENS project and technicalities behind it, so we offer hourly consultation sessions about the following topics:\r\nIntroduction to\u00a0ENS\r\nTechnicalities of ENS\r\nENS use cases for their business\r\n\r\nMy ENS Contributions\r\nArabic YouTube Educational Channel\r\nArabic ENS Sales Bot\r\nDomainsTheory.io\u00a0to help with ENS onboarding\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk me anything\r\nPlease reach out to us if you have any questions!

		"description": "This grant is part of the EDEN DAO experiment to use quadratic funding to fund planetary regeneration. Learn more about this radically open experiment here. This project is being developed and championed by Vlinder Climate @vlinderclimate because of their exemplary impact.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\u201cPapariko\u201d project is restoring degraded mangroves sites in Kwale, Kilifi, and Tana River counties, in Kenya. Vlinder is working closely with a local partner company, UMITA limited, and the Kenya Forest Service to create a healthy mangrove ecosystem in degraded areas, starting with planting in 2022. In addition to carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, the project also addresses environmental issues such as reducing the risk of natural disasters, promoting biodiversity, and linking forest fragments. An expected number of 1500 ha degraded mangrove areas on the Kenyan coast are restored and replanted. In the first project activity up to 138.000 mangroves will be planted in an area of 50 hectares in the Shirazi-Funzi complex in Kwale County in 2022. In the following three years, the project will expand to Kilifi and Tana River County. The species selected for this reforestation project are indigenous and local, namely Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina. The project will sequester an estimated 760,105 tCO2 over a period of 20 years.\r\nProject page on Verra: https:\/\/registry.verra.org\/app\/projectDetail\/VCS\/3660\u00a0\r\nProject page on Vlinder: https:\/\/vlinder.store\/vlinder-kenya-blue-carbon\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy did we choose this project?\r\nDuring the last 60 years, the forest cover in Kenya has dropped by 40%, losing about 12,000 hectares annually. Poverty is the main driver for deforestation, as people have to rely on charcoal for cooking and have to clear forests for agriculture. Mangrove ecosystem is an outstanding choice for restoration: storing 5x more carbon than terrestrial forest and up to 40x times faster sink, protecting the shore, and serving as a food reservoir for local communities. The project is designed in a way that 50% of the carbon benefits will be shared to local stakeholders and communities, contributing to alleviation of poverty and long term ecosystem stewardship.\r\n\r\nWhat is the impact of additional funding?\r\nMangrove restoration will increase soil carbon content and soil nutrient levels, improve water quality, increase fish populations, improve biodiversity, and provide other important ecosystem services.\u00a0\r\nGrant funding will contribute to:\u00a0\r\npurchase of the planting bags (1\u2019000\u2019000 are needed to establish a nursery for 2023 planting; each costs 1 KES, $0.00833);\r\nestablishing a baseline for biodiversity measurement (20 monitoring sites, 15 permanent sites + 5 control sites; 50 enviroDNA kits are needed, $150 for each kit, including delivery and lab analysis).\r\n\r\nHow do we verify the impact?\r\nThis project is independently verified according to the CCB and SD VISta standards (Verra). The Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) standard identifies projects that simultaneously combat climate change, support local communities and conserve biodiversity. The Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) is the leading standard for certifying the real benefits of social and environmental projects.\r\nIn addition to standard Verra certification, Vlinder implements full project area drone monitoring, measuring of the SDGs, conducting annual biomonitoring using eDNA of the water samples, focusing on changes in biodiversity overall and additionally on species classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List.",

The risk is that if we do not correct the course on DAO compensation and rewards practices, we will end up with \u201cthe great disappointment\u201d - A more disruptive event.\\\\n\\\\nWe are set to undertake a research project and provide the ecosystem with a deeper understanding of the topic, a shared language mapping the territory, a clear framing of the existing challenges for contributors and DAO leaders alike, and a mental model to define compensation and reward mechanisms.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe aim to deliver this research as a public good on composable \u201ccompensation and rewards\u201d primitives, taking a holistic approach that includes practices across ancient, traditional and Web3.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe deliverable\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe insights from our research will be delivered as a guidebook, which will help DAO people and web3 organisations to;\r\nAid their thinking and decision-making in selecting rewards and compensation mechanisms for their DAO.\r\nCommunicate and set expectations on rewards and compensation with DAO members\r\nMove the needle by inspiring new building blocks, tools, and articles building on this public good research.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe guidebook will consist of three parts.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPART 1: A map of primitives classified mainly on Value Creation Accounting (measuring the value of contributions) and Rewards and Compensation (distributing or attributing said value)\r\nPART 2: Considerations when choosing the primitive(s) to use\r\nPART 3: Case studies from the ecosystem (including learnings from using different systems).\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo help visualise, the primitives can be bounties, salaries, access to services, and reputation, whereas considerations can be viability for the DAO, sustainability, safety of the individual and aspiring to build a particular culture. As the research advances, we're expecting a growing list of primitives and consideration angles, and it will be our work to disentangle all the options and requirements into a usable, clear framework.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo gather the primitives, we will look at diverse organisations, geographies, cultures, and eras to compile the composable list.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow \/Execution\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe have a core team and contributors to carry out:\r\nDesk research on human needs and motivational factors.\r\nCompensation and reward practices across history and in Web3.\r\nConceptual developments in academia for compensation and rewards systems, frameworks, and language.\r\nResearch interviews with DAO leaders and contributors.\r\nA research survey to quantify findings.\r\nMapping and categorising of primitives and key considerations.\r\nDistilling the above into a practical framework.\r\nIllustration and formatting of the deliverable\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe are looking forward to advancing iteratively and sharing the public good guidebook with a wide ecosystem.",

		"description": "We are making a guide to the pluriverse! It is an interface between fanciful and purposeful labors. It keeps two worlds in balance: the integral vision of regenerative cryptoeconomics espoused by Gitcoin and the integral lore visualized by a whole community of sci-fi-fantasy-MMORPG-crypto-governerds.\r\n\r\nOur work is inspired by the Cellarius Universe Guide commissioned by ConsenSys. We interpret this project as an invitation: to dream wildly together, to meld the dystopian vision with our utopian ambitions, to meld the hopeful with the realistic, and take accountability for how our current focus on automated money might secure an intentional and optimistic future. Although Cellarius has fallen to the wayside, we wish to elaborate a fresh solarpunk vision with enough fidelity to allow a new audience of regen creatives to actualize these principles through their contributions.\r\n\r\nThe key to our pluriverse is to render the imagery at a sufficient resolution to make it feel immersive and purposeful, yet alien enough to avoid perpetuating our rivalrous desires. We\u2019re not talking about virtual cubicles or augmented meeting spaces, but a repository of that will probe the peripheries of the imagination. We are also just as interested in investigating how our virtual, augmented, and LARPing fantasies manifest in our meatspace habits and behaviors. The pluriverse is the UI between these experiential dimensions, and the Pluriverse Guide, DAO, and community are the incubators for our experiments.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent opportunity for the Ethereum community to elaborate on how our blockchain technologies can support fledging and speculative community development. We are dedicated to asking difficult social problems, meditating upon the tragedy of the commons, and securing support for public goods. We need to support each other to collectively peer beyond the apocalyptic veil, cross the threshold, and leverage our cryptoeconomic theories to manifest positive change in the world. We might take this opportunity to resist profiting off of our shared resources, to restrain ourselves from racing to the bottom, to rethink our motivations to preserve our abundance. Creatives have been used and abused so much that it has become a tragic-comic archetype, a living cliche of the disadvantaged visionary, the artist starving for cultural approval as well as a stable living wage. We need artists to continue asking the difficult questions, to crack us out of our collective neurotic, paranoiac, schizo-capitalist delusions, and dedicate themselves to imagining ways of moving beyond pure economic incentivization. We need artists to diminish the civilization\u2019s obsession with heroic identities and illustrate a clear (and realistic) tomorrow without enslaving humans to the protocols of distribution in the process. This is a sincere call to very deliberately and intentionally meme ourselves differently to each other.\r\n\r\nWhat is our lore?\u00a0\r\n\r\nStorytelling is the technology of imagination. The stories that we tell ourselves create the constraints of our worldview and our ability to actively world new worlds. If we are constantly reinforcing an imagination architecture that presents us as subordinate or enslaved to powers beyond our control, then abracadabra! So it shall be! That is the reality that we will occupy.\r\n\r\nWe must learn to manifest differently, and so we must learn to articulate differently, and so we must support each other to imagine differently. Who is the storyteller? What community do they represent? How is that community illustrated to itself and to others? How does the community orient itself to divergent perspectives?\r\n\r\nOur fantasies, myths, and markets suffer from scarcity. They provoke us to grind, to hoard, to incessantly level up. They are competitive and rivalrous, privileging customizability over standards that allow us to align and collaborate more effectively. How might we learn to change the canonical lore of our own imagination, to shift the narrative of the stories that we tell ourselves? We hope the Pluriverse Guide and the Gitcoin Comic series might support optimizing for human values, not perpetuating paperclip machines all the way down. We hope to play our part in this ontological game by strategizing to wield our memes with tact, subtlety, and profound nuance, to break the illusion of phantasmagoric shadow play that Moloch - which is to say - has cast upon our speculative future for far too long. We hope to nurture this community\u2019s propensity to imagine differently and confront the Moloch meme inside all of us. We must not sacrifice our future potential to the memetic chimera!\r\n\r\nCheers to a bright future! To a solarpunk future!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "A monthly periodical from the world of Loot Explorers that commissions and publishes quality fiction for an in-universe newspaper.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOverview\r\nWe are the Shapers' Society, a group of writers working as Loot Explorer characters within the Lootverse. We want to follow the example of The Genesis Scrolls and publish great lore for the Explorers era of Loot.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Explorer\u2019s Tribune already exists as a short newsletter that is sent out to holders of Loot Explorers. We want to redevelop and expand the Tribune in time for the launch of the Hideouts expansion for Loot: Explorers. The new Tribune will accept stories written by characters in-universe that could be (in-universe) fact or fiction. This would function as a way to keep collectors up-to-date with world events and updates, become an engine for driving Explorers lore, and encourage others to develop narratives within this ecosystem. \r\n\u00a0\r\nWe propose to accomplish this by putting out a call for writers to contribute stories to the Tribune. Each month, our editors will select three stories to be published in the next edition. To facilitate the professional and creative development of our submitters, our editors will provide written feedback to the top 8 submissions.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWith the grant we will be able to hire these editors to read and revise submissions from authors. There need only be two editors for each issue, and they can rotate their duties. Authors will be paid a flat fee for stories that are published.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe aim of the Shapers Society is to bring more attention, respectability and imagination to the Lootverse. We also want to grasp the golden opportunities arising with the dawn of Web3 publishing. The Eye for Adventurers and the Librarium are pioneering that model, and we believe that the Explorers world provides an ideal playground for brilliant minds.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Explorer's Tribune\r\nWe believe that now is perfect time to restart The Explorer's Tribune because The Loot Explorers team would like to feature editions of Tribune within their new Hideouts, as well as on their website. The Tribune will give added value to holders of Loot Explorers through exciting new fiction, it will reward creative people who are already enthusiastic about the world of Loot and will onboard new people, enriching the ecosystem with their ideas and experiences.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe will endeavour to make sure that, after publication, the stories featured in the Explorer's Tribune are shared with other relevant projects within the Lootverse, such as by contributing them to The Eye for Adventurers (as a society, we hold The Genesis Eye already).\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Budget\r\nA projected pipeline for each issue, with associated costs.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEditorial: The editors will read all entries and select suitable ones. The selected entries will undergo some rounds of copyedits, redrafts and tightening between the editors and the author. Rejected entries will be given meaningful feedback.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEach issue will have two editors and they will receive $150 each.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEditors for the first three issues (the scope of this grant) will be members of The Shapers' Society.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWriters: Successful submissions will earn their writer $200. We will include three stories per issue, so that amounts to $600.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWriters will be solicited from all corners of the Lootverse and beyond. Style guides and canon advice will be given by The Shapers' Society.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSocial Media Baron: Each issue will be publicised through official channels. We will release a truncated version of the tribune for social media in addition to the full version to holders. Furthermore, the selected entries will be pushed to other relevant projects within the Lootverse. All of these small tasks are apart from the standard editorial, so a separate role is required.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe social media baron for each issue will be paid $50.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRedesign: We would like an artist to redesign the Explorer's Tribune, building on the original template, so it aligns well with the tone of The Shapers' Society. They will need to create designs for the truncated and full versions of the tribune, as well as for the style guide. For this work, we will allocate $200.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis gives us an operating budget of $950 an issue, with a one-off starting fee of $200. Our proposal here is to raise enough for three issues of the new Explorer\u2019s Tribune as a pilot scheme. The total we need for all three issues is $3050.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Shapers' Society\r\nAs mentioned earlier in this application, The Shapers' Society consists of a group of writers working as Loot Explorer characters. In other words, all of our work will be completed in character; this would include all editing and feedbacking of article submissions, as well as running of social media channels. By embodying the \"Lore not Floor\" ethos in this manner, the Shaper's Society will contribute characterisations to both Loot Explorers and the wider Lootverse. Our society is open for people to join and is hosted as a guild in the Loot Explorer's Discord server. To give a flavour of our ethos, here is the Shapers' pledge:\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs members of The Shapers' Society, we burden a great responsibility. We map the past by developing the stories and legends we judge to be valuable and, by doing so, we erase the rest of history. It is our work that will be remembered; our work provides a shared culture for future explorers to build and expound upon. Hence, it is vital that we all take the following pledge:\r\n\u00a0\r\n+ As a shaper, I will collaborate, rather than compete, with my fellows.\r\n\u00a0\r\n+ As a shaper, I welcome criticism and when delivering my own criticism, I will ensure that it is constructive and actionable.\r\n\u00a0\r\n+ As a shaper, I understand that CC0 applies to work shared within this society, meaning that shared work is available for anyone to adapt or use as they like.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nMany thanks for your time reading this proposal. Regardless of the success of this grant, we hope the Lootverse keeps flourishing. \r\n\u00a0\r\nSigned,\r\nThe Shapers' Society\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Elroph \r\n- Ticklish\r\n- Mesmer\r\n- Psikos \r\n- Rymus",

Run Haus' digital community and IRL real estate infrastructure is organized to support outdoor running as a vehicle for a global revolution in personal and global consciousness, health, and sustainability. We know that a thriving world and happy societies are on the other side of a good run.\r\nOur public good mandates are providing group runs, events, community spaces, and housing that make it simple for members to get running daily in order to realize their fullest physical potential while connecting with a likeminded community and the planet.\r\nA coworking space for people who\u2019d rather not be working\r\nRemote work is redefining the modern meaning of success. Free from the stresses and time burden of office life, remote work is affording many professionals the space to recreate and build their lives around interests besides their professions.\u00a0A recent 4,000 person study found 28.76% of current runners started running during the pandemic, and for many, running has become an indispensable part of their lives, providing daily access to health, nature, and in-person community in an era when many are going the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nRun Haus' multipurpose community hubs are designed around the special needs and habits of this recreated, remote-worker-runner-human. Run Haus provides a centralized community, work, and cultural space to meet for a run, catch up on work, recover, socialize, share talents, eat, drink, laugh, and build a healthy, well-run world together.\r\nA home for people who people who are outside most of the time\r\n\r\nRun Haus is also building a distributed housing network designed around the needs of high performance humans and the tribal, interdependent ways human naturally organize their lives--doing this within America's problematic housing regulation and economics.\r\nRun Haus homes most closely resembles \"co-housing,\" which usually involves a shared single-family home or combination of homes that share resources, time, and each other's company. Run Haus homes puts people with shared values, habits, and lifestyles in one location, presenting myriad psychological, logistic, and economic benefits. Those shared values center on \"peak personal and planetary health,\" an ambition to make oneself, one's community, and the world as good as it can be, not merely as good as a broken status quo permits. More specifically, the Run Haus community is bound by commitments to:\r\nCarrying one's own weight, literally and figuratively.\r\n Continual improvement of one's body and mind through daily, strenuous physical activity, with a deep focus on running, specifically.\r\n Direct, in-person communication and interpersonal interaction. A deep respect and reverence for the natural world expressed in frequently connecting and spending time in nature away from modern stressors like social media, work, traffic, etc.\r\n Protecting the environment and live materially minimalist lifestyle.\r\n Continual intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth.\r\n Promoting economic, cultural, and generational diversity, equity, and interaction.\r\n Creative, not conventional, living. \"That's not normal\" is not a meaningful criticism for one's behavior, and should be considered a compliment.\r\nThe Run Haus DAO\r\nThe Run Haus coin is the community\u2019s primary currency and is earned through demonstrated value to the community; i.e. adding demonstrable services, goods, and efforts to the network and community and its related projects, external community services, etc. A sample use case for a coin exchange might involve a capital rich\/time scarce member trading coins with another member with more time than money, e.g. a semi-elite racer without a sponsorship.\r\nMembership privileges:\r\nAccess to like-minded, health and sustainability oriented community\r\n Access to spaces and events\r\n Access to in-network membership services and products: Coaching Physio and fitness classes\/instruction\r\n Professional services (writing, photography, video, accounting, etc.)\r\n Food and beverages\r\n Internal product marketplace\r\nRun Haus will organize first, in a transparent and democratic way, and then implement full governance tooling, and become a DAO.

We aim to reward your blockchain knowledge and ecosystem engagement with collectible NFT badges! Our collection of NFTs and knowledge they represent pay homage to the stitched badges that adorn scout sashes around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Telos Scouts is an interactive NFT adventure presented by your friends at Telos Culture. As a block producer candidate on the Telos blockchain, we know the benefits to collaboration across blockchains and want to encourage more people to learn about this growing industry.\r\n\r\nTelos Scouts makes it fun to learn about the blockchain!\r\n\r\nThe Telos Scouts will reward you for completing small tasks that lead up to blockchain mastery. You\u2019ll be able to join us on special episodes of Telos Culture\u2019s livestreams to receive your task and spend time with other Scouters. Come join in on a real Web3 jamboree!\r\n\r\nWe also know that Telos' strength, along with other Web3 ecosystems comes from a thriving community. So prepare to delve deep into different parts of our ecosystem\u2019s forests and engage with dApps to complete your Telos Scout sash! Telos Scouts will appeal to blockchain beginners and power users alike.\r\n\r\nWe know that a lot of work is needed to introduce the masses to blockchain technology. So what better way to do it than with a s\u2019more in your hand, a warm campfire, and scouting friends?\r\n\r\nAs the Web 3.0 industry evolves, many protocols have begun experiments in decentralized ID, social credibility and soulbound tokens. While the Telos Scouts' primary focus is to educate and build community, we also believe that the potential to incorporate soulbound tokens is quite exciting.\r\n\r\nThis would allow Telos Scouts to evolve into a protocol that can be leveraged as a tool for social credibility, aiding in sybil resistance for the many governance aspects that make up the Telos and Antelope ecosystem. We will open-source this development so that other projects can make use of this certification and identification system.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about Soulbound Tokens, decentralized society and social credibility? Check out some of the following resources to learn more:\r\nSoulbound\r\nGitcoin Passport\r\nPOAP\r\nDecentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul\r\n\r\nYour donation helps us build out our scouting syllabus.\r\n\r\nThe Telos Scouts need to build a beginner-friendly curriculum that will take anyone from zero blockchain knowledge to a blockchain power-user.\r\n\r\nBy contributing, you will help fund this curriculum development, as well as outreach to projects within the Telos communities. We\u2019ve completed the NFT art and have established our scout channels - your support will help us take the next step in bringing Telos and other blockchain tech to the masses!\r\n\r\nListen to the vision for the Telos Scouts:\u00a0https:\/\/youtu.be\/PujAhJuH46o",

This way the community gains collective strength to face the challenges presented to us all in the present day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCambiatus has been open source since day 1, and we believe our communities contribute a lot to the Regenerative Finance movement that is happening in web3. We were awarded the Shapers Awards in 2021 Blockchain 4 Humanity Prize and were also finalists at the Top Tier Impact Awards in 2021. We are collaborating with the ReFi Spring movement and always looking for ways to collaborate with planetary regeneration efforts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur partner communities became more financially resilient and less dependent on fiat money because they are using their own social currencies. They can reward members for actions that are related to their collective objectives and create an internal economic cycle.Those actions promote the community objectives, acting as an engaging tool that fosters the collaboration of people from different perspectives and experiences.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nExamples of those actions are: participating on beach cleanups, as a volunteer in an agroforestry task force, contributing to a given forest conservation area, and many others, that depend on the community context and objectives.\n\nWe would like to use this grant to keep onboarding new partner communities, develop more educational resources, and keep building new tools to our platform. One of our priorities will be creating content about web3, ReFi and social currencies in Portuguese and Spanish, to enable more people from Latin America to join our movement.\n\u00a0\nWe would like to show real life examples of how we can use web3 tools to empower communities and enable a transition to a low carbon economy, focused on financial resilience, connection with nature, wellbeing and the pura vida spirit!\n\u00a0\nCambiatus has an open source business model, and works on a voluntary contribution basis from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, as you can see in our plans. We also have ample experience doing deliveries, being a group of practical and hands on attitude.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe work with decentralized technologies combined with centralized ones, making one effective transition tool that has its head aiming for the future, but with our feet on the ground, using the best tools for the challenges that may arise.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur goal is to raise USD 50,000 and maintain our team for 4 months.\n\u00a0\n\u2705 Some deliverables we would like to achieve:\nCreate content in Portuguese and Spanish about the importance of web3 and social currencies in the current economic context.\nShowcase real life examples from Cambiatus partner communities in a way to incentivize other community leaders to take action and start their own social currency.\nLaunch Impact NFTs with all our partner communities.\nReview Cambiatus tokenomics looking for a resilient model.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udccd Our Tech roadmap:\nCreate governance tools that allow an Exit to Community process.\nEvolve the current marketplace to enable hybrid payments (FIAT + social currencies).\nDevelop the Roles and Permissions feature, to prevent fake accounts and other issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

		"description": "Overview\r\nOurlog is a decentralized communication tool for communities to log their research, thinking, and insights in a collective environment for the purposes of publishing. From scientific research, to government, to social groups, to web3 builders, Ourlog is a public, networked goods tool for any team to cohere and publish its collective intelligence. It\u2019s like Discord plus Wordpress for web3.\r\n\r\nAs a comms tool, Ourlog:\r\nfacilitates deep qualitative exploration of personal and collective information\r\nsupports distributed groups in finding coherence across complex topics\r\npipelines content from a private group environment to publish to the broader public\r\n\r\nBuilt in the Ethereum ecosystem, Ourlog is based on blocks as a primitive media component. Block content affords the ability to easily respond to, extend, challenge, curate, and develop your personal and collective thinking over time. Relationships between blocks are defined through a simple protocol, providing queryable context for your group\u2019s thinking.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to developing Ethereum\u2019s communications infrastructure, as we believe this to be a fundamental aspect of Ethereum\u2019s continued growth as a healthy, democratic system. Our focus is the development of public, networked communications goods.\r\n\r\nThe Need for Ourlog\r\nAfter building several projects in the Ethereum ecosystem, our team found it difficult to sustain ongoing efforts across multiple projects (see details below: Relational Projects). We worked best when we were together, physically, and wanted to bring the high quality in-person experience to our distributed team.\r\n\r\nBuilding on a shared practice of journaling in the mornings, we began an experiment using Discord as an Ourlog prototype. In a Discord server, each member has a channel to use as their personal research log and everyone on the team is welcome to read and tag messages to send them to a shared stream.\r\n\r\nFrom the shared stream, we bubble up highlights to publish as a way to capture our thinking at a point in time. In this way, Ourlog serves as a method to support self-organized group journalism. Currently, we\u2019re going for minimal editing, sharing our thinking in more-or-less the same form as it was posted to Discord. We publish our thinking based on Ourlog entries on Mirror: https:\/\/mirror.xyz\/0xb1CfC8e818fC40dB33F59caaeFe29B3FFc6aF65A\r\n\r\nCurrent Build Status\r\nWhile enacting a prototype of Ourlog in Discord and publishing our thinking on Mirror, we\u2019re also building an iOS dapp on the Polygon network and are working towards a full web dapp. We\u2019re in the early stages of the build\u2014everything we\u2019re sharing here is prototype and articulates our directional thinking for the tool.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the vision is for an iOS\/MacOS app with the following features:\r\na simple capture utility to provide a focused place to write, think, create, explore ideas\r\nseamless web3 experience on native applications\r\nsimple responding to other\u2019s posts\r\ntagging capability for posts\r\ncomposable query system for personalized viewports\r\n\r\n\r\niOS and MacOS dapp prototypes - capture surface; web dapp prototype - shared team stream\r\n\r\nSome of the high-level technical achievements to-date include:\r\ndeployed a number of Polygon smart contracts for basic Ourlog functionality: logging, commenting, tagging (these are the basis for the rlog protocol)\r\nindexed and built an arbitrary relationship system using TheGraph\r\nbuilt a novel implementation of smart contract wallets to enable seamless user experience iOS\r\n\r\n\r\nrlog smart contract wallet flow\r\n\r\nOurlog aims for a simple, out-of-the-box experience for technical and non-technical people alike. Ourlog\u2019s codebase is open source, so others can fork and customize it to fit their team\u2019s needs. In creating Ourlog, we\u2019re emerging a protocol for developers to build their own logging dapps. This emerging protocol (which we call research log, or rlog) is open source and in active development: https:\/\/github.com\/relational-os\/rlog\r\n\r\nFunding\r\nGitcoin funds will be used to continue building the Ourlog dapps as well as the rlog protocol specification. Specifically, money will flow to:\r\nOur team in compensation for time spent on design and development contributions\r\nCreating and launching a bounty program to expand and fund additional contributors on Ourlog\r\nCollaboration tooling and infrastructure costs (Zoom, Notion, Infura, Vercel, Figma)\r\nPolygon contract deployment and meta-transaction fees\r\n\r\nWho is building Ourlog?\r\nOurlog is a Relational project. Relational is an open media and communications collective, currently comprised of six founding members: Kristen Pavle, Dave Gorum, CJ Pais, Jon Borichevskiy, Tony Llongueras, and Jordan McCommons. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been building in the web3 space for almost 2 years; you can learn more about us, and what we\u2019ve been up to, including past decentralized publishing experiments, here: https:\/\/buzzard.life.\r\n\r\nRelational\u2019s vision is\u00a0a decentralized human communication layer built in the Ethereum ecosystem.\u00a0We take advantage of EVMs natively networked, naturally interconnected data environment to allow for communication to flow democratically.\u00a0Whether you\u2019re communicating through words, pixel art, or game experience points, Relational is interested in supporting your work.\r\n\r\nOne of Relational\u2019s core values is \u201cCommunity is a Verb\u201d\u2014we\u2019re organized around shared practices and routines.

FabHub empowers creators to secure their content so that it\u2019s only accessible to holders of certain NFTs or tokens. Usually, creating tokens that allow access to gated content requires technical knowledge. FacHub allows non-technical users to do so.\r\n\r\nTheir white labeled NFT product means that anyone can create an NFT store, regardless of their technical expertise. This approach allows users to avoid fees from platforms like OpenSea, giving more flexibility around user experience and more control over their brand.\r\n\r\nFacHub\u2019s white label NFT storefront product can be used by non-technical people, broadening the potential userbase of web3 technology. \u2018Lazy minting\u2019 means zero gas fees for creating NFTs, which is a welcome relief in today\u2019s high gas environment.\r\n\r\nHome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem",

		"description": "The goal of LanguageDAO is to lower language barriers in web3 through a combination of translation and interpreter services and mission-driven activities. The services include interpreting conference calls like DAO Twitter Spaces and translating crypto white papers, which often feature evolving technical jargon and regional slang that defy automated translation solutions. Revenue generated from these types of services fund mission-driven activities consisting of outreach into the marginalised countries, free education, and advocating for web3 organisations to increase language accessibility.\r\n\r\nHistorically, English has been the ubiquitous language of web3\u00a0(Bell, 2018), although that fact is changing. Although English-speaking countries make up the majority of job locations on the web3.career\u00a0(Web3 Career, 2022)\u00a0website, just over half of the top 50 countries are non-English speaking. This is one indication the web3 industry is flourishing across the world. Subsequently, web3 teams will increasingly need to communicate with other teams who speak a different language.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, crypto markets are booming throughout the global landscape, hungry for products and services. Nigeria, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Turkey rank the highest in terms of crypto adoption rates\u00a0(Buchholz, 2021). Additionally, 60% of consumers say they will not buy a product\u00a0(CSA Research, 2020)\u00a0if they cannot read the marketing language. The market in China for Bitcoin rapidly expanded once Satoshi\u2019s whitepaper was translated into Chinese\u00a0(Bell, 2018). Understanding a crypto market, and the underlying technology, is fundamental to participating in that market.\r\n\r\nWeb3 presents an opportunity, allowing unbanked individuals living in countries with limited banking systems access to financial services. Additionally, web3 can enable entrepreneurs to sell goods abroad, when these individuals would otherwise struggle to connect with international payment systems\u00a0(Scott, 2016). Yet, persisting language barriers threaten to cut off marginalised countries from the opportunity of web3\u00a0(Bell, 2018). To further complicate the problem, terms for blockchain infrastructure, DAO governance, etc, can specialise within different geographical and cultural silos. Eventually the industry may settle on open standards, but in the meantime lingual and cultural translation has the potential to play key roles in facilitating both commerce and coordination\u00a0(INATBA, 2020).\r\n\r\nOur past and present partners include PeopleDAO, PizzaDAO, PandaDAO, CultDAO, and Gitcoin (Greenpilled).",

And, it would allow researchers to run AI algorithms on a data set without ever obtaining direct access to the data. This protects the privacy of all the individuals contributing to the data set while at the same time giving valuable insights that might lead to the creation of many improvements - including better AI-powered services or improved treatments for women't health challenges or diseases\/STIs; and\r\n\r\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the data and the platform itself will not \u2018lift people out of poverty\u2019 \u2013 Knowan must focus on the users of the data to generate insights that can turn into action to improve data outcomes.\u00a0We would do this through a DAO structure - with governance, treasury, strategy, voting, and growth led by the community. Through this organization, we can leverage the global community of SRH experts, technologists, data scientists, community workers, advocacy organizations, health providers, donors, AI experts, and individuals - really anyone in the ecosystem \u2013 to organically learn, earn, and innovate together to work towards solving this challenge.\r\n\r\nKnowan seeks to lay the infrastructure and frameworks for more effective and coordinated\u00a0disseminating, exchanging, and sharing data by governments, international organizations, donors\/foundations, civil society, research entities, the private sector, and individuals.\u00a0By doing this, Knowan seeks to enhance accountability, improve policy making and service delivery, and increase business opportunities.\u00a0We will enhance accountability by enabling the use of data to improve policies with data-driven decision making and more effectively advocate for increased funding with supportive evidence.\u00a0We will improve policy and service delivery for women and girls by enabling the leveraging of data to ensure more transparency, supply chain improvements, quality use of social media for education, enhanced research capabilities and sharing, and improved cost savings through efficiencies. And, we will increase business and economic opportunities \u2013 enabling more data for fem-tech startups, improving products, ensuring cost savings, and increasing the production process.\u00a0And we will rely on our growing community to create and champion those additional solutions and protections that only those with lived experiences and a unique understanding of the issues can champion.\r\n\r\nFinally, by creating a space in web3 and data science that is focused on solving issues affecting women and girls, and emphasizing participation by those with lived experience in solving the issues, we will support them in their journeys in the web3 and\/or data science.\u00a0This will provide the additional benefit of educating and encouraging more participation by women and girls in web3 and data science.\r\n\r\nAs a social enterprise, the funds will be used to support building the ecosystem - with a specific focus on building the platform and completing an upcoming pilot in Uganda. \r\n\r\nWe envision a world where sexual and reproductive health inequalities are a thing of the past!

These self governing groups have evolved to include various loaning mechanisms and staking and rewards systems. It is estimated that over 300,000 registered chamas exist today in Kenya, with members collaborating in more than one1 chama in their lifetime.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a push towards digital options for bookkeeping that increase transparency and improve governance such as Aturi and Ecobba, many of these groups remain informal, relying solely on the bridge of trust that brought them together in the first place. This informal sector worth over $4bn in Kenya has increased grassroots development and involvement. Communities take charge of their own investments and tailor their financial system to fit their culture i.e. the funeral fund, which is traditionally how Kenyans fundraise for funerals.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop pilots to onboard Chamas to Web3 to enable them to\u00a0\r\n- Scale using digital technology\r\n- Develop additional revenue streams including ecosystem credit generation and sales\r\n\r\nPotential Pilots: \r\nMangrove Reforestation\/EcoCredits\r\nWomen\u2019s ReFi savings group - Women from farming communities\r\n\r\nThe project is being developed with a one -year timeline with the below requirements\r\n\r\nStaff:\r\n- Developers\r\n- Implementation, Training & Support:\r\n\r\nPeriod of time for implementation & results:\r\n1 Year.\r\n\r\nMilestones:\r\n- Setting up the DAOs (2 Daos, one in Kenya and potentially one in India, Indonesia or Myanmar) We\u2019re creating a DAO incubator, including tech tools, community support, feasibility studies. \r\n- Feasibility report for other regions\r\n- Prototype of a community staking pool for impact investment\r\n\r\n\r\nKPIs:\r\n--People reached\u00a0\r\n- Impact on community, documented through multimedia\/human interest stories\r\n- Outreach and discovery\r\n- DAO Design Toolkit\r\n\r\n\r\nSocioeconomic Benefits of Success\r\nThe foundation creates a case study for the global financial sector - proving DeFi can be used for impact investment products in emerging markets.\u00a0\r\nThe potential market size of East Africa alone is massive with 11 million community owned savings groups already in existence.\u00a0\r\n\r\nContact details : contact@regen.foundation\r\n\r\n",

BanklessDAO launched on May 4, 2021, and its goal is to drive adoption and awareness of truly bankless money systems like Ethereum, DeFi, and Bitcoin.\r\nTogether, the BanklessDAO community collaborates to create user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralised financial technologies through education, media and culture.\r\nThe BanklessDAO community runs a variety of projects; for the scope of this grant we are focusing on the ones which truly provide goods and services for the entire world such as BANKLESS ACADEMY, BANKLESS AFRICA, BANKLESS RESEARCH and INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES.\u00a0\r\nThe projects listed below have had contributors working on them for many months and although some of the project contributors earn governance tokens, the work being done far outstrips the existing remuneration. Second, and perhaps more important, is that all these projects aim to help the wider crypto ecosystem and not just the Bankless community \u2014 and hence are public goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKLESS ACADEMY\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude80 Brief\r\nBankless Academy is a leading web3 \"knowledge on-ramp\" - a practical & engaging education experience with infrastructure preparing to be scaled across the blockchain multiverse.\r\nWe're helping the world adopt the permissionless tools they need to go Bankless.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd25 Vision\r\nWe are building a web3 world where:\r\n\ud83d\udcda Information is frictionless and free.\r\n\ud83d\udc4a Communities are high impact creators.\r\n\ud83c\udf10 Education is permissionless (no central body dictates what you can\/can't see).\r\n\r\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Trajectory\r\nCurrent focuses:\r\nEstablish a Bankless-native syllabus\/user journey to move users from Centralised Exchanges to Ethereum Layer2 self-custody.\r\nPursue collaboration with popular dApps to educate users on trusted tools available to them.\r\nBuild theory lessons with expert guests from the Bankless 'Hall of Fame'.\r\nForm frontier partnerships so that the Academy dApp continues to support interoperability and cutting-edge use cases.\r\nContinue research, development, and onboarding for our whitelabel platform to scale our efforts into other web3 ecosystems.\r\nBuild a framework for contributor content creation to empower talented community educators.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcc0 Try the dApp:\r\nhttps:\/\/app.banklessacademy.com\/\r\nMultiple wallets supported\r\nMobile friendly\r\nNo download\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0f Let's scale permissionless education together!\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKLESS AFRICA\r\nOur community is focused on promoting the bDAO mission. We leverage crypto-based creations like Bitcoin, Defi, NFTs etc. to tackle problems faced by Africans.\r\n\r\nAchievement\/Growth:\r\n*Our podcast highlights projects and people making impact in the African crypto\/Web3 ecosystem.\r\n*Our Newsletter provides well curated information on Bitcoin, DeFi, crypto regulations, projects and Web3 funding in the crypto\/Web3 space in Africa.\r\n*Our website helps Africans access educational courses. It includes a link to Bankless Academy where lots of Web3 courses are available. Eventually this website will become a native-educational platform for Africans.\r\nWebsite v1 here: https:\/\/banklessafrica.com\/\r\n*We onboard and train contributors with various Web3 ethos, teaching them how to contribute in various DAOs and potentially bootstrap project ideas they have.\r\nSome links to get into our community: https:\/\/linktr.ee\/banklessafrica.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKLESS RESEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nBankless Research provides in-depth, rigorous and investigative insights into web3 topics across the board, thereby being able to draw on a wide web of contacts within the space. While our special focus lies on DeFi and governance issues, we are happy to also cover any other topic of interest to our clients. Due to our experience we have been able to develop successful formats to address the most sought after requests, thereby retaining the flexibility to tend to specialists\u2019 requests, requirements and ancillary services individually.\r\n\r\nNotable achievements:\r\nIn cooperation with the BC Grants Team, we managed to secure a grant from TribeDAO to develop a research report for them. The result was a 45-page long breakdown of the TribeDAO ecosystem. Saddle Finance was the second Web3 project for whom Bankless Research has conducted research for. We have also started reaching out to potential partners, who are aligned with BanklessDAO mission, and with whom we will form strategic partnerships based on our objectives.\r\n\r\nCurrent situation in the market:\r\nWeb2 companies currently profit twofold: by charging readers a monthly\/yearly subscription granting access to research reports which these companies receive grants for to write. Problem is this research often barely scratches the surface of the projects, contains outdated information and\u00a0is published before showing the content to the client.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nOur solution:\r\nBankless Research aims to solve these problems by:\u00a0\r\n\u2714\ufe0f Forming a team of subject matter experts with experience in web3.\u00a0\r\n\u2714\ufe0f Utilizing the procured team of experts to conduct professional research.\u00a0\r\n\u2714\ufe0f Collecting trusted resources for analytics data.\u00a0\r\n\u2714\ufe0fApplying qualitative and quantitative analysis to deepen the understanding of a project.\u00a0\r\n\u2714\ufe0f Establishing and maintaining a deep connection with the client\/grant donor, enabling the facilitation and collection of feedback after the final report is ready to be published.\u00a0\r\n\r\nUse of funds:\r\nFunds received in GR15 will directly support operations within Bankless Research, including bounties for research work.\r\nWe are planning to build a website to help us onboard clients and researchers as well as facilitating the exchange between all parties and providing access to educational material.\r\nFurther the continuous expansion of our tooling repertoire will be supported.\r\nFinally we will explore and use different channels to help market our services and products to a wider audience to achieve a healthy, long term growth trajectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0f INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES (IMN)\r\nOnly 5% of the world\u2019s population are native English speakers and roughly 15% speak English on some level. The initial goal of the IMN project is to reach the remaining 80% by translating and distributing content about blockchain technology, DeFi, the Metaverse and Web3. All links: https:\/\/www.banklessimn.xyz\/\r\nThe International Media Nodes project believes in the liberating effect of going Bankless and what it can do for improving financial wellbeing and stability throughout the world. Creating and maintaining communities of people who do not speak English and educating them\/opening the door for them to onboard to Web3 is one of the most crucial pieces of infrastructure if we want Web3 to be any different from Web2.\r\n\r\nThe story so far\u2026\r\nIn Q1 2022, the total audience grew by 52% as compared to the previous quarter and our total reach is over 40,000 audience members in over 20 languages. We have more than 100 active contributors speaking 20 different languages from all parts of the world. We have worked with prominent DAOs in Web3 such as Polygon, Tribe and Yearn.\r\nOver the next months and years, as we continue to produce content we will also start developing local language communities which will develop Web3 talent in local languages as well as organising events in different geographical locations to onboard more people.\r\n\r\nOur Ask to the Crypto Community ...\r\nAt the highest level, the Web3 education provided by BanklessDAO stands to empower humanity with the informed decision-making required in our digital future. We firmly believe that we align with the vision of the Gitcoin Community, and that together we can work to slay Moloch.\r\nWe seriously can\u2019t wait to show you what we have to offer this space.\r\nLet\u2019s Impact Together!\r\nBanklessDAO believes in the liberating effects of going Bankless and the impact our ideal can have on improving the financial stability and wellbeing of our world, both in learning and translation. With the help of the Gitcoin Community, we will accelerate the spread of an ungated Web3 education for everyone.\r\nLet\u2019s help the world go Bankless!",

Our product will serve as the extension for the ENS holders, where they will be able to assign CNS policy on who will be eligible to mint the subdomains. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCNS policies consist of Token-Gated and Allowlist address:\r\n\r\nToken-Gated: The ENS owners can create a policy which requires the party that owns a certain ERC-721 token to be eligible for minting.\r\nAllowlist Address: The ENS owner can directly assigns the Ethereum address that will be eligible to mint the subdomain.\r\n\r\nThe subdomain that is minted from our website will be in the form of\u00a0ERC 721 soul-bound token, where each minter can have access to the subdomains in terms of utility while representing their community through subdomains. Our aim is for the community from each respective community to adopt our products, starting from\u00a0NFT projects to DAO communities. \r\n\r\nAs one of key success factors toward Web 3.0 Projects is the empowerment of the community. In correspond,\u00a0CNS allows the user to map their Ethereum address to the subdomains they prefer while represents their community simultaneously\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Progress: \r\nOur product has launched on Rinkeby Testnet, with over 1200+ communities created on our platform.

By building a next-generation NFT architecture based on resource-oriented chains to express various social relationships and interactions in the Web3 world, and asset all this, so that the value of social capabilities of every participant could be confirmed and clarified.\r\nPunStar\u00a0is an initial form of this social network. Firstly, we will build this platform on Flow due to its unique resource-oriented features and next this will be extended to more resource-oriented chains like Aptos and Sui. Besides static content features and combinability of normal NFT, we take advantage of resource mechanisms to coalesce some innovative properties into NFT and asset them. The innovative properties include dynamical social relationships between participants established by resource interactions, executable abilities based on methods bound to resources (some of which have realistic meanings, e.g. advertising), and upgradeable features like\u00a0Funny index\u00a0which may actually increase NFT's value.\r\nIn this stage, PunStar chooses\u00a0Funny things\u00a0as the entry point of the social network, which could be easily extended in the future. The participants of PunStar are called \"Punsters\" (an NFT) and they can share their funny things in the form of \"Duanji\" (an NFT). Each person can express their preference for a \"Duanji\", which can stimulate the construction of social relationships between participants and let it possible to estimate the \"funny index\" of each \"Punster\". The \"Punsters\" can make content promotions(e.g. publish ads) based on their relationship constructed in PunStar, which needs to satisfy some restrictions based on the \"funny index\" first.

For example, the funny index will increase if someone's\u00a0Duanji\u00a0is commended by others.

It can not only make the filecoin system more readable and user-friendly, but also become an important infrastructure for web3.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat can FNS do?\r\n\u00a0\r\n- FNS provides a secure and decentralized way to resolve on-chain and off-chain address resources on the Filecoin network into simple human-readable domain names.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Users can use FNS as an identity to access the web3 world, and only need to integrate the DNS domain name into FNS, and their domain name can be used as a wallet, Web3 username and a decentralized website.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- For payment, users can use FNS to transfer native FIL assets. By simply connecting FNS to DNS, transactions can be sent to specific websites for payment without going through a payment middleman.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Decentralized network, FNS addresses can be used with IPFS\/Filecoin. For example, websites can be stored on IPFS\/Filecoin by connecting FNS or integrating into DNS to IPFS\/Filecoin. FNS provides decentralized domain name services, while IPFS\/Filecoin is a decentralized file storage system, which together constitute a decentralized network.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Text record feature enables FNS users to add various information to FNS records.\r\nFor example: email address, url, avatar, description, notifications, keywords, Github username, etc.\r\n\u00a0\r\nsome new ideas\r\n- FNS can be bound with the file CID, and the file search process can be optimized to optimize the user search experience.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Use FNS to create bookmark bar, favorite system, and optimize the file management mode in Filecoin storage system.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Use FNS to build a Web3 personal resume system.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAt the same time, FNS also joined the early builder program of FVM Foundry officially launched by Filecoin.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It has seen a dramatic increase from 5.4% in 2020 to up to 33.51% in 2022.\r\n\tWe underwent surveys and found out that this high unemployment rate was not so much a result of unemployability (in the form of poor education or illiteracy in tech) but mostly due to the unavailability of native job offerings.\r\n\tThis prompted us to create a DAO whose major goal is eradicating unemployment in Africa and the world by teaching, connecting, and providing job opportunities by annexing the decentralised digital market.\u00a0\r\n\tProXify DAO aims to do this by educating and onboarding contributors majorly from Africa and then the rest of the world to maximise, improve, upscale and apply their skills in Web3.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is ProXify DAO?\u00a0\r\n\tProXify DAO is a service DAO that educates, trains and mentors contributors to become skilled Web3 technical service providers; and ultimately connects them to clients (organizations, other DAOs, etc.) that require their services.\r\n\tWe believe that the future of work is decentralised; and by utilising the DAO model, we assemble and train a community of the best service providers (ranging from writers, designers, developers, researchers, product testers, to marketers, etc.).\r\n\tBy collaboratively sharing workspaces, resources, knowledge, and training contributors willing to upskill, we contribute to the future of Web3.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProblem Statement\u00a0\r\nThe unemployment rate has been a major concern in the world (Africa especially)\r\nMonopolised Web2 companies require unreasonable certified qualifications compared to the pay.\r\n\tOrganizations also find it difficult to access quality services that they require, having to go through strenuous recruitment\/application processes to get the job done right.\r\n\tWe, therefore, noticed the gap between these organizations and creative\/technical services.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSolution\u00a0\r\n\u00a0ProXify DAO bridges this gap by:\r\ntraining and educating unskilled contributors trying to upskill;\r\nreaching out to and onboarding skilled service providers previously oblivious about the concept of decentralization and DAOs;\r\nonboarding skilled Web3 contributors;\u00a0\r\nsourcing for organizations that need specific jobs done;\r\napplying for these jobs as a service DAO;\r\nemploying the respective skilled contributors to carry out the job within the agreed timeframe;\r\ngetting the job done!\r\n\u00a0\r\nNotable Accomplishments:\u00a0\r\nProXify DAO has accomplished these within a month of its launch:\r\nonboarded over 100 skilled contributors and according to our survey, 23 were entirely new to the concept of Web3;\r\nwe have bountied and paid out tasks to engage our community;\r\nwe formed a partnership with Domain DAO, handling their digital marketing (within this period, they generated over 400 $ETH in Juicebox contributions; even amidst a bear market!).\r\n\u00a0\r\nFunding Breakdown:\u00a0\r\nFunds received in the GR15 will be used directly to support operations within the ProXify DAO. This will include;\r\nCreation of an official ProXify DAO website;\u00a0\r\nOnboarding check\u00a0\r\nTo help the grow the ProXify Community by providing funds for bounties to keep the community motivated.\r\nTo help create an extensive web3 course and Educational App.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProxify DAO will like to thank the proxify community for their support and hopes you will join the proxify mission.",

Composability, open data, airdrops, tokens, DAOs \u2013 all these things can be confusing even for web3 native people, let alone builders who are just entering the space.\r\n\r\nThat's why almost a year ago, I started Web3 Talks, a podcast where web3 builders share their experiences to inspire the next generation of founders.\r\n\r\nSeb Audet, Co-Founder @ Zapper explaining how they choose which features to include in v2:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we're focused on builders, we don't talk high-level VC stuff like \"What is Metaverse?\" or trading-oriented things such as \"Which coin should you invest in 2022?\". Instead, we focus on questions such as \"How have you acquired your first users?\", \"How do you take care of your community?\" or \"What were the biggest technical challenges you've faced so far?\r\n\r\nChris Whinfrey, Founder @ Hop Protocol explaining how they protected their airdrop from Sybil attackers:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already recorded 27 episodes. I spoke with founders of smaller projects and with well-known founders such as Seb Audet (Zapper.fi), Dennison Bertram (Tally.xyz), Chris Whinfrey (Hop Protocol), Auston Bunsen (QuickNode) & Austin Griffith (Scaffold.ETH).\r\n\r\nThe podcast has 1,2k subscribers across the 3 biggest podcasting platforms (Spotify, Apple, Google) and has been well-received by the builder's community.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadhavan Malolan, Founder @ Questbook explaining what helped them to build a 15,000 developers community in 2,5 months:\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the start of last year, I have treated this podcast as a side project I financed from my pocket. But this model has its limits. So if I received a grant, I could dedicate more time to record more episodes, organize all the lessons shared by the builders so far, and promote the podcast around builder's communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Antibiotic resistance kills more people a year than HIV\/AIDs or malaria, especially in low and middle income countries. This grant will be used to extend the reach of our existing decentralized innovation program and support even more open science projects in Africa.\u00a0\r\n\r\nObjectives of the Giant Lab:\r\n\r\nFight antimicrobial resistance in low and middle income countries (starting with Africa)\u00a0\r\nFor this we are:\r\nNurturing a network of scientists, engineers and NGOs who collaborate\u00a0\r\nDeveloping Open source solutions (for prevention, diagnostic and treatment)\r\nProviding a MOOCs to improve understanding in antibiotic resistance\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo far:\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the first wave of our \u201cAfrica against antibiotic resistance\u201d program, with just 5000 euros,\r\nwe mobilized more than 200 scientists from Sub-Saharan Africa (mostly Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda),\u00a0\r\nWe supported the creation of 9 projects and created an educational MOOC facilitating the training of 89 participants whom have gone on to further success professionally, with some participants now part of government-funded PhD programmes, becoming advocates of open science and antibiotic resistance .\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith this grant:\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe seek to expand the network to 500 members\r\nWe will support at least 10 open science projects using our microgrant approach\r\nWe will enrich the existing MOOC even more to provide educational and data resources for underfunded and undertrained professionals online\r\n\r\nBudget\r\n\r\nWe have two initial goals for this grant: 10000 dollars and 30000 dollars. If we get more, the extra funding will go in priority to supporting even more projects.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMicrogrants [50%]\r\nIncentivizing the project holders using microgrants (up to 2000 dollars) for validated projects - this goes a long way in the global south.\r\nOrganization of two rounds (one every 3 months)\r\n\r\nJOGL Operations and Infrastructure [50%]\r\nCommunity mobilization and animation\u00a0\r\nCreation of the program flow for applicants\r\nMobilization campaign (graphics and social media)\r\nSupport to the community (community events)\r\nDigital Infrastructure Development\u00a0\r\nSupport of the continuous improvement of the JOGL open source infrastructure\r\nMaintenance of the platform\r\nFellowship and Leadership of programme\u00a0\r\nEvaluation of the community program\u00a0\r\nSharing of the observation as a public report after 1 year of activity\r\nCreation of the program flow for applicants\r\nAnalysis and sharing of peer-review results\u00a0\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, Antibiotic resistance has become a major global development issue, threatening environmental, veterinary, and human health. Antibiotics are potent tools against bacterial infections, however microorganisms previously known to be sensitive to some antimicrobial agents are developing partial to complete resistance against them. This can be combated using traditional academic techniques and is already being researched by many labs across the world, however global health and research capacity is not uniform. Development of systems, more open to medical labs and community labs, where universities are less concentrated is essential. This capacity can be granted through proper application of open science, and connection of these communities online, such as that of our project. We aim to develop open and taught materials and a database for tracking of antibiotic resistance\u00a0 by the international community sustainably. Then use this model to scale up community lab capacity and independence. We have created a method of \u201cCommunity Review\u201d whereby applicants have say in grant outcomes, and a decentralized community is formed.\r\nOpen science is a global movement that aims to make scientific research and its findings accessible to the general public. Its collaborative and participatory ethos presents an opportunity for a bottom-up approach to research and development that is beneficial to the public. It embraces digital technologies to build communities, work processes, and tools, while embracing frugal innovation achieving significant results with minimal resources. We have already achieved this, through a global program to great effect with minimal funding during the COVID19 pandemic with OpenCOVID19, we can repeat this on antibiotic resistance\u00a0 to create a grass roots antibiotic resistance\u00a0 surveillance community.\r\n\r\nSpecific Aims\r\nImprove our society\u2019s resiliency to biothreats by increasing our antibiotic research capacity, especially against local resistance which can become a global problem. This is through empowerment of local peoples to do their own research - through a \u201ccommunity review\u201d grant allocation.\r\nTrack new emergence of antibiotic resistance through community science and continue the creation of an emerging antibiotic resistance database\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe model in this proposal, whereby enthusiastic individuals are trained and selectively given funds to improve the world and community aims to build a more just and sustainable world, by doing more with less, for enthusiastic and under represented people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If a DNS hijacking happens, with a simple browser plugin we could perform a check and avoid users being scammed\r\nother areas where a certification is required\r\n\r\nCertification is obtained by publishing the hash of a given file on chain. When the block containing the hash is minted, the timestamp of the block identifies the date at which the certification has been approved. For what concern the hash, we have adopted the standard SHA-256 hash, so that the risk of collision is negligible.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the management of generated proofs, each one is treated as a standard ERC-721 token (NFT). In this way the proof is tradable, movable and easily viewable.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFinally, while the file can be stored privately, it can also be made public (on a permaweb, currently supported Arweave). In this way the public URL of the file is included into the NFT proof metadata. Due to the decentralized approach, to make sure the file at given URL matches the hash, a Chainlink Oracle is used.\r\n\r\nMain advantages of our solution can be sum up in 4 points:\r\nDecentralized: anyone can interact with our smart contract to generate a tProof\r\nNFT based: this makes the management of proofs easier and more practical, while integrating in multiple existing tools\r\nMulti-chain: the protocol is studied to support multiple chain, while keeping unique IDs among the different chains. Initially Ethereum and Polygon will be supported\r\nFile management: files can be kept private or public, based on the needs\r\n\r\nWe are planning to launch our tool on both Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, but other chains will follow.\r\n\r\nYou can already try it for free on Goerli Testnet.

In order to avoid the issues associated with reputation systems (e.g. sybil resistance, reputation calculation, sovereign-identities etc) experimentation and testing will be required until the final architecture is settled.\r\nPilot Cohort and First Module: The initial module would focus on \u201cDecentralised Science\u201d. It would equip students with in-depth knowledge on crypto primitives such as the blockchain, decentralisation and DAOs as well as a deep dive into the scientific method, data analysis and interpretation and appraising scientific publications. Through this we experiment and fine tune the P2P based self organised form of learning.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo find out more, read our LitePaper.",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7419\/barichara-regeneration-fund-prototyping-a-bioregi",
		"description": "About\r\nThe Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale. Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000-hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat Has Been Accomplished\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nLand and the Ecoversity\r\nThe BRF works to restore ecological health through a multifaceted strategy of weaving together current regenerative projects in Barichara, purchasing land for regenerative work, and creating groups and organizations to facilitate this work. Already, the BRF has raised $50,000 to purchase a heavily degraded plot of land, Origen del Agua, and has begun regenerative work on it.\r\n\r\nRecently, the BRF has secured a second piece of land, Las Albercas, that will be the future home of the central campus of the Barichara Ecoversity. Here an off-grid campus will be created to provide on-the-ground training in various regenerative techniques such as permaculture, rainwater harvesting, renewable energy solutions, and syntropic agroforestry. The Barichara Ecoversity will serve as an integrating hub for both research and education in the territory with the Las Albercas campus serving as a place for experts and students to gather to teach and learn the skills needed for restoring planetary health, all while cultivating a deep connection to the land.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSyntropic Agroforestry\r\nOne of the central projects of the BRF has been spreading syntropic agroforestry throughout the territory. Syntropic agroforestry aims to foster climax ecosystems independent from outside inputs with an emphasis on plants geared towards maintaining food for human consumption. This works through the planting of food crops next to support species that aid with water retention, the fixing of nitrogen in the soils, the creation of shade, and the production of biomass to continually provide organic matter to cover the soil and enrich it over time. These methods encourage a process of ecological succession to occur as would happen in a natural process of forest expansion, just much faster and focused on supporting edible species. The process is one of syntropy with increased growth, diversity, density, and complexity throughout the entire system compared to conventional or organic agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe BRF has supported the creation of syntropic agroforestry projects throughout the territory. A syntropic agroforestry expert was brought to Barichara and has been teaching local farmers within the region. Specifically, two three-day design classes on syntropic agroforestry have been offered, giving participants a technical explanation of the principles of the technique and then hands-on instruction through the creation of two field sites. The demand for syntropic agroforestry has been great in the territory, and our aim is to continue supporting those wanting to learn on their journey towards transitioning to regenerative food production.\r\n\r\nOther Work\r\nThe work of the BRF is constantly evolving in relation to what is emerging on the ground in Barichara.\r\n\r\nA community council was set up to coordinate regenerative action in the territory with funds from the BRF being used to support fifteen local projects in the community, greatly facilitating the development of relationships among these projects in the territory.\r\nAs its successor, we are in the process of creating a Territorial Foundation to formally facilitate the reception of funds and mediate their use in a process ensuring consent and support from the local community.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts combine to form a cohesive and self-reinforcing Bioregional Investment Platform where the individuals and organizations dedicated to regeneration cyclically flow value amongst each other, creating a consistent spinning out of social and ecological value for the entire territory. With your help, the BRF aims to support this ever-evolving process of territorial regeneration.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNext steps for the BRF\r\nThe work of the BRF has been ongoing for nearly three years, and much has been accomplished in that time. The relationships developed through this work and the land that has been acquired has given the BRF the foundation on which to pivot to long-term strategic planning to ensure the holistic restoration of the entire territory. One of our partners and collaborators, Commonland Foundation, has created a landscape investment framework currently utilized by fifteen territories around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir model is a five-step, twenty-year process to produce a self-sustaining regenerative economy, geared towards social and ecological improvement. Key to the success of this model is the formation of a core team with enough funds to dedicate themselves completely to this work all throughout the twenty-year period. This initial investment in a core team provides the supports necessary to ensure that the work reaches maturity, and a regenerative economy can form and begin to sustain the entire territory. This core team is currently in development and will continue the work of the ongoing regenerative projects in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development and funding of this core team forms one of three major funding efforts for the BRF. The second is the funding and construction of the Ecoversity, described above, and the third, the support of the current regenerative projects in the area. These three overarching projects will allow us to move towards holistic landscape regeneration at a bioregional scale. In total, this amounts to raising $500,000 in the next year to accelerate this work. The funds gathered through the Gitcoin grant round will be directed towards this purpose.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nReFi Barichara\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe will also be holding an event, ReFi Barichara, from October 3 to 7, taking place between Cosmoverse in Medell\u00edn and DevCon Bogot\u00e1. ReFi Barichara aims to be an entirely different kind of Web3 conference. During the event, participants will be able to directly engage with the ongoing flows of an active regenerative economy with field site visits to the various regenerative projects in the area allowing attendees to get their hands directly involved with regenerative work. We will also be holding design workshops centered around applying ReFi tools to the local context as participants connect to these on-the-ground projects. All of this will be held through an emergent process of facilitation as the learning that occurs during the event shapes the development of the event itself. We want to create an opportunity for the participants to learn from a living laboratory of regenerative finance and see how ReFi tools can be utilized in a real community and landscape. In the run up to the event, we have already begun to collaborate with various ReFi groups and organizations like RegenNetwork, ReFi Spring, RegenFoundation, and Celo Foundation as well as starting a learning journey to prepare people from the on-the-ground regeneration space for taking advantage of blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.regeneratebarichara.org\/refi\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ReFiBarichara\r\n\u00a0\r\nVision\r\nAll the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.\r\n\r\nLearn More\r\nBRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others\u2019 experiences. He and others from Barichara regularly provide updates on their progress in videos and articles on the network.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about regenerative work in Barichara visit: https:\/\/www.regeneratebarichara.org\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Earth Regenerators visit: \r\nhttps:\/\/earth-regenerators.mn.co\/",

Amidst all the talk about getting carbon credits to the communities most at risk, there\u2019s a significant gap in the storytelling about these communities who are an unequivocally integral part of the stakeholder solution. We'll make sure their stories are told. Our plan is to make ReFi compelling and relatable to investors, Web3 creators outside of the ReFi ecosystem, and consumers who are ready for a climate narrative that promotes hope and positivity instead of crisis.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits and Perks for Funders\u00a0\r\nAll participating funders will get credit as supporters of the docuseries. Anyone who contributes more than 100 dai will get producing credits and the opportunity to visit filming locations, as well as a chance to get one-on-one training from regeneration experts featured in the series.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTEAM Bios\r\n\r\nMelissa Jun Rowley\u00a0\r\nMelissa Jun Rowley is the founder and CEO of Warrior Love Productions, a Web3 studio and production company creating projects and protocols supporting social impact and climate positivity.

		"description": "Future Folklore is building a funding platform for materials science and technology efforts surrounding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). With growing interest from the United States Congress, NASA, key researchers at Stanford and Harvard, and others, there is a tremendous opportunity to work on one of the great mysteries of our time. This is where the DeSci movement is crucial: the UAP subject is of global importance, calling for open and broad-based collaboration and ownership in the research.\r\n\r\nFuture Folklore has three broad focus areas:\r\n\r\nMaterials science: Funding labs to conduct analysis on recovered UAP materials.\r\nEngineering & inventing: Funding technology innovations to better conduct UAP materials science, and novel technology which integrates insights from materials science.\r\nEcosystem development: Developing this nascent ecosystem through networking and incentivizing new and existing contributors, such as academic metallurgy labs.\r\n\r\nFuture Folklore will use this grant money to support DAO structuring, and set-up, operating, and other related expenses.\r\n\r\nFF is looking to grow its team and form working groups, covering task areas like sourcing and distributing materials for study, or networking metallurgy labs. If you\u2019re interested in web3 and the UAP subject, please reach out!\r\n\r\nBackground: UAP, materials, and science \r\n\r\nAre UFOs real?\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional de Costa Rica\r\n\r\nBranches and high-ranking members of the US Government have repeatedly and recently said UFOs are real and are to be taken seriously. Their preferred term is unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), now expanded even further to \u201cunidentified aerospace-undersea phenomena.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Department of Defense via AP\r\n\r\nThis new name, though cumbersome, is a nod to the \"transmedium\" performance characteristics of some of these anomalous vehicles. In other words, some seem able to pass through space, air, and water domains. In one well-known case, Navy operators report tracking \u201cobjects [that] appeared suddenly at 80,000 feet, and then hurtled toward the sea, eventually stopping at 20,00 feet and hovering. Then they either dropped out of radar range or shot straight back up.\u201d \r\n\r\nEventually some pilots were told to rendezvous with an object, which they discovered was hovering above the water, \u201caround 40 feet long and oval in shape\u201d and moving erratically. After engaging with the object, which responded by moving up, \u201cIt accelerated like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d one pilot said. Within a minute it was mysteriously tracked at their next rendezvous point 60 miles away, but was gone when the pilots arrived. Congressional hearings on UAP this summer, the first in over 50 years, confirmed that this case is still unresolved.\r\n\r\nIn June 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published a report on UAP, saying some UAP \u201cappear to demonstrate advanced technology,\u201d and that \u201cSome UAP appear to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nCongress has mandated their new UFO office, now named the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), to study the technology and intentions of UFOs. They have also requested that the new office not study objects deemed man-made. New legislation already in effect also requires of the new office \"the testing of materials ... to better understand and explain unidentified aerial phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nAre there such materials? In private hands yes, some, and of these, some with solid and independent witness testimonies and chains of custody for the materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: \"Improved instrumental techniques\"\r\n\r\nDr. Garry Nolan, professor at Stanford, inventor, entrepreneur and holder of 40 US patents, has been studying recovered UAP materials. As lead author, he recently published this peer-reviewed methods paper with a case study: \"Improved instrumental techniques, including isotopic analysis, applicable to the characterization of unusual materials with potential relevance to aerospace forensics\" in the journal Progress in Aerospace Sciences.\r\n\r\nSpeaking with\u00a0VICE, he has also said some material in his custody have unusual isotopic ratios: \"...if you find a metal where the isotope ratios are changed far beyond what is normally found in nature, then that material has likely been engineered\u2014the material is downstream of a process that caused them to be altered. Someone did it. The questions are who\u2026 and why?\"\r\n\r\nAnother recent study with a lingering \"why\" was published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, analyzing the 1957 Brazilian Ubatuba UAP fragment. They found \"One definite strangeness\" with the sample\u2014a strontium impurity. \"The strontium impurity is not a normal by-product in the manufacture of magnesium and would have been intentionally added.\" Here's a brief video surveying the study of UAP materials.\r\n\r\nMany wonder if the US Government has more material, and more that\u2019s intact and operational\u2014even entire craft. It\u2019s difficult to determine. The New York Times has reported that classified briefings have been given to Congress concerning \u201coff-world vehicles not made on this earth.\u201d\r\n\r\nNASA\u00a0recently began engaging in formal UAP research, saying they're taking it very seriously: \u201cWe're going full force \u2026 This is really important to us, and we're placing a high priority on it.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Avi Loeb is a professor Harvard and was the university's longest serving chair of the Astronomy Department. He recently founded The Galileo Project, whose mission is the systematic, scientific search for evidence of extraterrestrial technological artifacts. This notably includes attempts to capture images of UAP. They'e installing ground-based telescopes for this, including on the roof of\u00a0the Harvard College Observatory. The Galileo Project already has post-doctoral fellowships.\r\n\r\nFuture Folklore's conviction\r\n\r\nMuch more could be said, and more studies and contributors mentioned. Future Folklore stands on the conviction that if there's the slightest chance materials associated with UAP have an exotic origin, then funding and analysis is paramount. It may not surprise readers that funding channels are thin or nonexistent. The philosophical and technological possibilities, though possibly slim, are too great to ignore.\r\n\r\nFuture Folklore also stands on the conviction that organizational models enabled with web3 technology are appropriate for the study of UAP, which requires an all-hands approach. We need broad-based collaboration and ownership models. For those new to decentralized science models, here is a recent profile published in Nature Biotechnology covering some leading DAOs. \r\n",

Each post is a question, an opinion, or a poll. You can open a post and read what others say anonymously and, if you wish, reply anonymously.\r\n\r\nYou can make custom compilations using tags to see what people say on certain topics and in certain locations.\r\n\r\nA post can only contain text so that no one could track you. We don\u2019t gather location data to guarantee anonymity. Our profile pics are avatars. When you post, you can choose your avatar\u2019s emotion.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re for the real freedom of speech. This means that the feed may contain posts that you may not like. We\u2019ll mark such content for you. It\u2019s on you if you want to read that or not. If you see content like this and it\u2019s unmarked, let us know and we\u2019ll reward you and take measures immediately.\r\n\r\nResonance is our internal currency. You can spend that to customize your avatar. You can\u2019t buy it, but you can earn it by reacting to posts, creating ones, and leaving comments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAvatars\r\nEvery user has an avatar instead of their real identity. At first it\u2019s the anonymous pigeon in a hood.\r\n\r\nYou can get your avatar in exchange for your resonance. It\u2019s random, but you can always change certain attributes in exchange for your resonance. They are also randomly generated and are of different quality: basic, rare, legendary. Legendary attributes turn your avatar into an animated sticker, and you can use it to react to posts. The sticker stays in your collection for good.\r\n\r\nYou can change your avatar\u2019s emotion to one that reflects your current mood and pick an emotion for a post.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo get access to an avatar and to earn resonance, you need to create an account. We don\u2019t gather any personal data. Your nickname is randomly generated. Your password is a seed phrase. Store it in a safe place, best of all \u2013 in your mind. It\u2019s the only thing associating you with the platform.\r\n\r\n**How we guarantee safety**\r\n[work in progress]\r\n",

The ability to send messages between, users, addresses, and machines, is so fundamental and important that it should (and in the long run needs to) be driven and owned collectively by developers and users (all mankind). This is why we've built Web3MQ so that anyone can participate by hosting nodes and growing the Web3MQ network just like Ethereum.\r\n\r\nFeatures & Use Cases\r\nDMs: Let users and users connect\r\nNotifications & Web3 mail: Allow projects to notify and send asynchronous messages to users\/wallets.\r\nChat & Community: Build community amongst your users. Web3MQ is one of a handful of Web3 messaging protocols that natively support group chat from day one. \r\n\r\n\r\nCharacteristics\r\nInteroperable: We reconnect isolated social platforms with a unified inbox, enabling information to be freely generated, flowed and communicated across terminals. All you need is the other person's address or compatible DID.\r\nScalable Fast (we're serious): Web3MQ is not a toy network with a Web3 concept. We're seriously designing this to serve the next billion users in Web3. We're already faster and more scalable than any other Web3 messaging network and are approaching Web2 performance.\r\nComposable: Web3MQ is built to be maximally composable. We focus on building the best messaging network. Storage, encryption, and public chain compatibility are designed from day one to be maximally composable. Developers can achieve higher levels of privacy protection and satisfy other personalized features\/needs through highly customizable configurations.\r\nNatively Multi-Chain: Web3MQ is a middleware infrastructure network, our design is fundamentally compatible with any chain, and with minimal extensions, can send messages between addresses between any two chains.\r\nOwnership: No singular party can tamper with your messages or dictate the way you build on Web3MQ, it's a collective network of nodes. Web3MQ will ultimately be driven, refined and updated by the community,\r\n\r\nAlpha I\r\nWeb3MQ is currently in our Stage One Alpha. We're open to applications from projects and developers to partner with us and try out the Web3MQ network! Form link: https:\/\/rt7tivqoksf.typeform.com\/to\/M3xKzJ8v\r\n(To guarantee performance, early Alpha stages require a developer key to connect, the eventual mainnet is committed to being permissionless.)",

		"description": "About\r\n\r\nSproutUp is the web3 charity startup platform. SproutUp let\u2019s anyone turn good deed videos into NFT impact certificates and earn crypto donations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy\r\n\r\nThere are two key bottlenecks to solving climate and social issues:\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship\r\nAccountability\r\n\r\nNonprofit laws create red tape, fees, and financial incentives for founders. And traditional donations do not hold organizations accountable for impact. Donors have little idea how their money is used.\r\n\r\nAs a result, our nonprofit sector is captured by decades old, legacy organizations that don\u2019t innovate. These nonprofits have been failing to solve climate change and other issues for the past 50 years. We need to empower the next generation web3 organizations.\r\n\r\nHow\r\n\r\nSproutUp solves these issues with impact certificates. SproutUp users turn their project outcomes into NFT impact certificates. For example, a tree planter can turn videos of their planting projects into impact certificates. Each donor gets one unique tree impact certificate for their donation. Donors know exactly where their money goes and get to own proof of their unique tree project forever.\u00a0\r\n\r\nImpact certificates align incentives for more impact. Currently, most nonprofits use the same fundraising business models regardless of their work. SproutUp will create many different types of impact certificates, enabling web3 charities to tailor their business models to their work. This lets web3 charities align their own needs with those they serve, their donors, and broader society. A win-win-win-win.\u00a0\r\n\r\nImpact certificates promote entrepreneurship. A key barrier for nonprofit startups is trust. Donors prefer large brand-name organizations when making donations, as nonprofits offer little transparency. Impact certificates give donors perfect transparency, enabling founders to more easily fundraise. The sub-saharan tree planter can now out compete the global NGO.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe transparency of impact certificates also makes nonprofit status irrelevant. Founders can start a SproutUp web3 charity and create impact certificates in minutes without any nonprofit fees or red tape.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to support climate social impact founders. Our impact certificates live on the carbon-negative Polygon blockchain and use IPFS for decentralized metadata storage. Gas fees are less than a penny, eliminating any financial burden for founders and donors. \r\n\r\nFunding\r\n\r\nThis is a one-person bootstrapped team! Your funding supports my continued work on SproutUp. Every little bit helps. Without funding, I may soon have to put SproutUp on hold.\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Nate, the founder, developer, and sole team member at SproutUp. I\u2019ve been working in sustainability and the social sector since my first environmental nonprofit internship 10 years ago. I previously built a \u201ccommon app for nonprofit grants\u201d.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy twitter:\u00a0\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/natvancleve\r\n\r\nProject status\r\n\r\nWe are currently onboarding Alpha users!

And almost 100% of that amount came from businesses & corporations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we\u2019re going to remove atmospheric carbon at the scale we need to impact climate change, we need to mobilize consumer funding.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut how? Historically, consumers won\u2019t pay to fund carbon removal.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Solution\r\nHazel, our web3 platform, empowers consumers to take direct steps to remove carbon and fight climate change. By rewarding consumers with fun, valuable NFT rewards that they can use in Hazel, we\u2019re making it fun to help reverse climate change.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith Hazel, users will be able to:\r\n\ud83c\udf31 Fund carbon removal & unlock rewards that enhance their Hazel experience\r\n\ud83c\udf31 See & learn about the projects they\u2019re funding and visualize their positive climate impact\u00a0\r\n\ud83c\udf31 Earn NFT rewards for using Hazel, which automatically generate carbon-removal funding when sold\r\n\ud83c\udf31 Have fun while making an impact on the planet!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA fun & empowering gaming experience\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of climate doom out there right now.

We are grateful to our family for always having our back, to our friends for always keeping us happy, and to the Earth for all it gives us to sustain life. To enter the gardens is to acknowledge and give attention to these reciprocal relationships with everyone and everything. Because, for us to be who we are today, it wouldn\u2019t be possible without them. Our lives are all so interconnected and dependent on each other. Gratitude, though, is not enough. Kangra Gardens is also a place to give back to the Earth for all it does to take care of us. To do this, we give back by respecting, listening, and learning. Our life on Earth is a gift itself, but so is being able to be present in the gardens.\r\n\r\nKangra Botanical Garden will be visited and enjoyed by thousands of visitors per year, representing a tremendous opportunity for making the connection between the public and sustainable and regenerative agriculture. Kangra Gardens promotes native biodiversity and regenerative agriculture through its focus on its Regenerative, Ecological and Syntropic Farming area. It has five critical practices for implementing biodiversity conservation that could be adopted by people in their agricultural and animal farms, and which fit with the regenerative farming philosophy. While creating practices to creating and sustaining open-source documentation.\r\n\r\nWe are further providing a system for the local and international community to engage equitably. We are giving the opportunity for local populations to contribute any good case practices for biodiversity conservation through regenerative and ecological agriculture in your area. Contribute with names of new botanical plants that we may not have in the garden. Travelers visiting and connecting with the cause of Regenerative, Ecological and Syntropic Farming areas. Learn something new about Regenerative, Ecological and Syntropic Farming. Followed by contributing your ideas and take home some ideas. All in all, this is part of a bigger initiative with Kula about establishing a deep sense of belonging in the global community to connect globally and act locally through the funding as well as supporting public goods! This grant stretches across multiple ecosystems because regenerative work is not only technical and scientific, but also spiritual and cultural.\r\n\r\nMap of Garden\r\n\r\n\"Action on behalf of life transforms. Because the relationship between self and the world is reciprocal, it is not a question of first getting enlightened or saved and then acting. As we work to heal the earth, the earth heals us.\" -Robin Wall Kimmerer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n\r\nThe Kangra Botanical Garden is the central project of Kangra Gardens, designed to support and embody everything the company stands for. It is home to various EduCARE India projects and integrated with them in order to achieve goals such as community health, food security and nutrition, and engagement with visitors.\r\n\r\nThe various purposes of the botanical garden are to regenerate the ecosystem and promote the conservation of biodiversity, to support community health, to build towards food security and nutrition, and to engage people in connecting better with the environment. For community health, the garden grows herbs for Ayurvedic medicine production. In order to build toward food security and nutrition, another section of the garden uses syntropic farming to grow food and regenerate the ecosystem. The community garden and 'Regen Learning Center' aim to provide visitors with a sense of belonging in the environment through experiential learning. With this grant we aim to be able to fund new contributors and their development of open source documentation to share with the larger regen global community.",

		"description": "Alexa doesn\u2019t understand my voice. Many other women face the same bias in current AI models ranging from failed facial recognition to loan applications. Why are AI models struggling in recognizing gender, people of color and other communities?\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe majority of Web2 AI development is currently developed by a homogenous group of people and either controlled by large tech companies or Western Ivy league universities. With a lack of diversity comes a lack of empathy and imagination for the needs of society at large. AI companies heavily overrely on datasets of data-rich countries and this skewed data training has led to the discrimination for the rest of world.\r\n\r\nstories_of_ai is applying for funding to drive DEI engagement for their DAO framework for decentralized AI teams and their communities.\r\n\r\nProposal\r\n\r\nstories_of_ai\u2019s research highlights that there is surprising a lack of DEI collaboration in AI and Web3, the majority of Algovera\u2019s squads are white, male and\/or from data-rich countries. We would like to change this.\r\n\r\nWe like to build bridges so that AI teams can easily form interdisciplinary teams and connect with communities and data. We envision the co-development of AI models and that communities will receive returns for their data. Communities need the ability to co-design, get transparency, contribute data, retrain AI models, and get remunerated.\r\n\r\nstories_of_ai is a squad in the Algovera ecosystem. Algovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications.\r\n\r\nDeliverables\u00a0\r\nGrant funding will accelerate research and co-design on the 2nd pillar of our Decentralized AI DAO framework called \u201cCommunity Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur deliverables are:\r\n\u201cCreating bridges\u201d.\u00a0\r\nActive outreach and open call for DEI communities.

The DAID framework enables how AI teams and their community can keep ownership of, and monetize their AI model creations. DAID also provides tools and strategies in how to build a decentralized AI DAO that is based on a vision of human cooperation, augmentation, sustainability and DEI.\r\n\r\nAbout Algovera\r\nAlgovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications. stories_of_ai has received one Algovera grant to date for work developing a Decentralized AI DAO framework (DAID). Algovera Grants has funded 28 independent AI teams (called Squads) to date. Algovera also trains squads to use decentralized AI infrastructure, which consists of decentralized storage, compute and marketplace.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nCentralized AI systems do not actively consider community ownership or how to integrate gender, racial or sustainability factors in developing AI models. Researchers have highlighted the harm of AI models that are benchmarked in human-competition, autonomy and centralization [How AI Fails Us: Divya Siddarth, Glen Weyl et al. 2021]. They propose a human-centered vision of developing AI models that complement, cooperate and support society rather than compete with humans.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe like to propose pluralistic strategies of how to develop decentralized AI organizations. We believe that bringing together diverse communities within web3 and squads would be mutually beneficial to the community.\r\n\r\nThis is why stories_of_ai has developed a Decentralized AI DAO framework (DAID) which accelerates AI teams with technical tools and strategies that are rooted in interdisciplinary team work, human-centered design, ethics, sustainability and community commercial models.\r\nDAID consists of 4 key areas:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0 \u00a0 Primary - Design Thinking: who is the user and who is impacted by my AI model?\u2028\u2028\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0 \u00a0 Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.\u2028\u2028\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0 \u00a0 Decentralized AI activities: from data sourcing, storage, training, deploy to publishing AI models to market places.\u2028\u2028\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04\u00a0 \u00a0 DAO activities: covers how to set up a DAO, governance, proposals, treasury management and member protection and monetization of data sets and AI models\u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nWork Package 1\r\nOur aim is accelerating interdisciplinary teams to push towards the development of AI Web3 projects and DAOs. Our goal is to bring together communities such as everyday people and Black in AI, women in web3\/AI, LGBTQIA+ with GnosisDAO, Data Science for All, Ocean Protocol, IPFS and Algovera.\r\n\r\nGrant funding will provide research and co-design on the 2nd pillar of our DAI framework \u201cCommunity Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur deliverables are:\r\n\u201cCreating bridges\u201d.\u00a0\r\nActive outreach and open call for DEI communities.

		"description": "Our mission is to create a powerful healing modality for domestic violence victims using art to process trauma, practice self-sovereignty, and self-determination, and increase their sense of self-efficacy.\r\n\r\nParticipants will work through a series of abstract expressionist art exercises focused on increasing their sense of unique and individual identity, boundaries, and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nReadings or discussions paired with the exercises and either in-person or online support, will give participants opportunities to practice and gain a deeper understanding of the rights they have as a person to make their own decisions, to try new things, to trust their voice, to increase the confidence they have in themselves, to process trauma, to heal, and to bring beauty into the world.\r\n\r\nOur intention is to create an open-sourced web3 platform (dApp) to enable these workshop leaders and participants to create NFT representations of their physical art and to introduce the participants to the world of web3 in general. From de-fi to privacy protection, web3 is where workshop participants can find the tools they need to further practice self-sovereignty, self-determination, and self-efficacy.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a session, we will explore past (and recently recurring) trauma, putting it on canvas through color, energetic mark-making, drawing, and then overwrite those using artistic expressions that bring the creator peace or catharsis.\u00a0 Self-expression and expelling traumatic events via physical manifestation are dynamic tools in building an individual's sense of control, identity, inclusion, and visibility.\u00a0 Each person will paint, draw, scrape, scratch and\u00a0 get the traumatic event on the canvas one way or another, and then layer over it or incorporate it into the final piece, much like we must incorporate grief into our psyche in order to keep living healthily after a loss.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt sounds intense as it\u2019s written here, and parts of it may be, but we will teach real skills and techniques in a way that is playful, fun, exploratory, easily accessible to people with no previous arts experience, and completely non-judgemental.\u00a0 Our hope is that through numerous interactions over the course of a year, people will feel empowered and understood in new and important ways.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe United States is the most dangerous country in the world for women, in 2022, according to world population review. \u00a0 Intimate partner violence (IPV) results in 1300 deaths and over 2 million injuries in the US, ANNUALLY.\u00a0 75% of those deaths occur when a woman attempts to or has left.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n1 in 3 women worldwide has been forced into sex, beaten, or otherwise abused by their partner.\u00a0 Domestic violence affects women of color disproportionately, especially severe physical violence.\u00a0 Black women are the most likely to be beaten severely and to die from domestic violence in the US.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWomen between the ages of 18-24 are the most likely to experience domestic violence, followed by teens between the ages of 11-17.\r\nThis is when you look at the statistics of what is REPORTED.\r\n\r\n\u201cGetting away is a mother fucker. It is dangerous. It is TERRIFYING. I know because I've done it. \u00a0\r\n\r\nMy ex-husband tried to kill me by pushing me down a flight of stairs to a concrete floor in view of our 4-year-old son. \r\n\r\nMy daughter's father, a different man, dragged me out of bed by my hair, broke my finger, choked me, and squeezed my jaw so hard that I could barely open my mouth for 4 days. While I was pregnant. When I finally got him out of my house and had a restraining order, I woke up to him standing over me as I slept after breaking into my home. He was not arrested, despite the restraining order. \r\n\r\nTherapeutic art has been one of the most powerful tools in our recovery.\u201d - Maaike \r\n\r\nPrograms exist but aren't sufficient.\r\nThere are domestic violence resources to leave. There are escape plans.\u00a0 There are advocates who will guide you through the court process.\u00a0 These resources are stretched thin as paper and require call after call to access them.\u00a0 You know who can\u2019t make call after call and get return calls?\u00a0 Women who are living under the thumb of a domestic terrorist.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are countless recovery programs for abusers that are paid for by the government and, usually, court-mandated. In addition, there are endless free (and paid) recovery\/rehab programs for addiction to alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, and eating disorders, including many 12-step meetings across the US daily for these issues.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nFor people who have experienced abuse, recovery programs are few, not well structured, and underfunded. As a result, you often find people with good intentions running a circle of stories centered around the abuser (codependent behavior) that often turns into the suffering Olympics rather than focusing on the woman, her progress, and her well-being.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nGetting and staying in an abusive relationship results from not having a clear sense of self and firm boundaries. The red flags that typically occur long before abuse escalates to becoming physical would end the relationship for people with healthy boundaries. The problem with never having had any agency over yourself is that you don't understand that LEAVING is the correct response to abusive behavior or that you even have that as an option. While ending the relationship and respecting yourself is the right answer, no person alive can do those things if they don't know deep down that they CAN and have an intrinsic power over their own life. People who are raised with a lack of autonomy simply have no idea about personal boundaries, let alone how to apply them. Sometimes they don't even understand that a person who is hurting won't just decide to stop.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo be clear - abusers are 100% responsible for the abuse they dole out. There is no BLAME for the person who is abused. \u00a0\r\n\r\nPeople need to be taught how to move forward, and there is a glaring lack of help. To work their way up to leaving an abusive situation or to rebuild themselves after they have left, they need to discover their identity away and apart from the negative patterns of abuse, likely all they have ever known. This is the space we aim to fill.\r\n\r\nIn the curriculum we are outlining, the most important thing is developing a sense of self and the absolute value of each individual's perspective, expression, taste, and message, all of which happens in the inner world.\r\n\r\nNeil Gaiman said, \"The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, sparking the imagination of the inner world of an individual and repeatedly affirming the value of their voice is one of the most revolutionary things you can do, especially for someone who is being or has been oppressed. What happens inside of us belongs only to us.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFunding will go toward:\r\nCurriculum development\r\nSpace and material costs for in-person workshops for women and children\r\nFilming demos and video editing for online use\r\nCreating a web3 platform whose functionality will include\u00a0\r\nManaging the workshops\r\nOnboarding participants to web3 by helping them understand web3 better and get a digital wallet if they don't have one.\r\nCreating NFT collections (using Unlock Protocol on Polygon) representing progress throughout the workshop. They will ultimately end up with a history of their process from start to finish, a story of their healing.\r\n\r\nFuture Goals:\r\nAdditional curriculum material from a diverse group of artists - ongoing\r\nGain widespread adoption of the curriculum for use by domestic violence services and individuals nationwide\r\nCreate a variation of the curriculum to be used with kids as a DETERRENT to domestic violence\r\nBroaden the potential benefit to people who speak a wide range of languages beyond English\r\nAdditional goals will be added as they become clearer\r\n\r\nMaaike Fettah, Founder\r\nPersonal History & Experience\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have been painting since 1995. I am a self-taught artist, gathering information and skills from a few college classes, a handful of online courses, YouTube tutorials, extensive reading, and art evaluation, and just DOING it.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPainting has been many things to me, but it has been most relevant to therapy and life. I believe that art in all its forms is one of the most powerful means of personal transformation and restoration. While my current art practice is primarily about bringing beauty and joy into a world that can be very harsh, I have used art to process grief, build my sense of self, and exorcise traumatic events and their memories.\r\n\r\nI started in oils and worked sporadically in that, aerosol,\u00a0 and other mediums as a means of self- expression until 2010.\u00a0 At that time, I began to use art to process trauma, specifically domestic violence and rape.\u00a0 The art therapy techniques my son was taught\u00a0 after witnessing his father try to kill me, were essential to his recovery, and led me down this path.\u00a0 I began working in acrylics\/mixed media and found a magic I had previously only known through making music.\u00a0 I have also worked in watercolors, primarily in 2011 and again in 2019, when we were in Morocco, during which time I created an entire body of work - 30+ pieces - over a 5 month period, and solidified my desire to move toward being a full-time artist.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, abstract and emotional expressionist art is a profoundly impactful form of visual communication that allows both the creator and viewer to be moved in profound ways. My current work explores vibrant color, texture, shape, movement, and storytelling by imbuing the canvas with energy and emotion.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe most significant history of my past and current work can be viewed on my Facebook page https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/iMaakeArt.\r\n\r\nI have a degree in Mass Communication and Journalism with a minor in Psychology which informs my understanding of visual communication. In addition, I have studied brain and behavior correlation and taken a deep dive into PTSD, trauma, and recovery from it.\u00a0 I have taken several courses in Group Therapy and believe what I learned about group dynamics will be an asset.\r\n\r\nMy track record connecting seemingly divergent groups of people through art and music spans nearly 3 decades. My career as a financial planner speaks to my ability to communicate complex ideas in an easily understandable way, manage numerous relationships simultaneously, network broadly, and steward resources responsibly. I am accustomed to floating between groups of vastly different socio-economic and cultural situations with consideration for all and an eye to my own internalized biases.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently I am the Chief Alchemist and Art Director of Sunshine Alchemists & Soap Co and Night Sun Candle Company, businesses I have founded over the past 7 years, as well as an artist. We employ women coming out of domestic violence and give them flexibility and support to maintain financial solvency while remaining available to their children. Receiving funding for this project will enable me to shift further into community healing and art and free up finances to create additional employment opportunities there.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nI have lived a great deal of life, which has given me a tremendous amount of compassion.\u00a0 My parents were Christian fundamentalist pastors with a church and school in Montana. Our family lived in the abandoned forest service building that also housed the church and school.\u00a0 We showered at the Y across the street.\u00a0 There was no real kitchen.\u00a0 Our power was turned off regularly.\u00a0 I know what it is to live out of a gym bag and rely on the kindness of others for food. I had my first job at 12, out of necessity, touching up frames in a factory. Thankfully, my path also led me to live in the Bay area, New York, here in New Mexico, and to spend time in New Orleans and Miami, with people from all over the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0I have learned that how I was raised and what I thought was normal was far from it and that unlearning is an intentional process which is ongoing.\u00a0 I have lived through\u2026 way too many violent incidents of varying natures, and as Lin-Manuel Miranda says, \u201cWrote my way out.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nAngela Steffens, aka wonderwomancode\r\nCo-founder Personal History\r\nAs a woman who has had a long career in tech, I'm excited to be involved with a project that I feel will significantly impact bringing more DEI to the space. But, more importantly, I am confident it will reduce the suffering caused by domestic violence and hopefully it will reduce the numbers by ending what can sometimes be generational patterns. I started my career more than 20 years ago when I graduated with a degree in computer science. Since then, I have worked as a full-stack developer, architect, consultant, engineering lead, and founder. As a result, I have the skills necessary to help bring organization and coordination to this project to ensure the funding received is used as efficiently as possible and to guide development on the web3 platform in a way that will see actual results. I've been involved in the web3 space since 2018; currently, I work for a web3 protocol, belong to many DAOs, including several others with a focus on DEI, and serve on the board of advisors for several other web3 companies.",

		"description": "pRoots\u00a0is a tool we build with web3 technology for people to store, share and learn genomic information and grow into a sharable genomic knowledge network. And we will aggregate the knowledge from the growing biocommunity and openbio projects, which DNA information as the cornerstone. Scientists, non-traditional bioresearchers, and citizen bio explorers can be connected together through the genomic information they both focus on and annotated with.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmpower people to share synthetic biology-related genomic information with ownership and the possibility of community building through the common interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of sequencing, synthesis, and editing DNA dropping rapidly and the new bioecolonomy is rising\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople now can be much easier to get into biotechnology development due to the lower cost of DNA sequencing, important bio patents expired, open-hardware movement, 3D printer technology, and wetware distribution (freegene project, iGEM, addgene....). The growing biocommunity expanded globally and there are almost a hundred of DIYbio labs. People are willing to share synthetic biology knowledge. Most of that information is related to genomic information and annotation. And there are lacking good ways to empower people to share and keep the ownership of this precious knowledge, such as a certain modification of the promoter region with A-> T can improve enzyme production to another level. This pain point is what pRoots designed to solve and bring web3 technology to accelerate the people to sharing certain genomic knowledge related to synthetic biology and be connected together due to the census interesting in certain regions of DNA sequencing (beer brewers exchange certain yeast genomic information through annotation in a similar region and be connected together).\r\n\r\nBiolog is coded and programmed in DNA. \r\n\r\nBiology is software encoded in DNA. And most of the information is not easy to store, share, and annotated in a more open manner. Most of the genomic information is stored by the governments and traditional academics (such as NCBI and Ensembl)  In another way, as more and more DAOs raise funds for bioscience development and decentralized science, there will be also the necessity to build the infrastructure to deal with the related genomic data. pRoots will let biolabs, DAOs, and amateur bioscientists easily allocate the web3 resource as the functionality to deal with their sharable knowledge of genomic information.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic usage of pRoots can do to build a community around genomic data sharing \r\n\r\n\r\nDeSci DAOs can use pRoots to construct their funded research group to share their genomic data \r\n\r\n\r\nCurated and bridge the open science into sharable knowledge and people can annotate and interacte with it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 1\r\n\r\npeople will use pRoots to store DNA data (fasta, fastq, bam) as easily as possible in a decentralized storage system.\r\nenable DAOs and scientists who received crypto funds can use our tools to store, share and annotate their genomic data in a web3 manner\r\npeople can view their DNA data such as plasmids from a browser with a useful viewer and store the metadata in a decentralized way\r\n\r\nPhase 2\r\nprovide an interactive way to let the genomic metadata connected and sharable, and aggregate the current important synthetic biology open plasmid data to bridge the web3 and current biocommunity.\r\nbridging the current open bio community such as global biocommunity, freegan, iGEM to provide they to use this tool to store, share, and annotate in pRoots\r\n\r\nPhase 3\r\n\r\nprovide API to let DAOs, other web3 service to create smart contract with genomic data request \r\n\r\nUpDate:\r\n20220917 thank you for the support we received from the crpyto community, and we will begin to give back to the community and bring more open science people to know the gitcoin platform and how they can use this platform to do public good, the first step is bringing out the plan to support the iGEM team in our local region and we hope in the near future we can reach out to more iGEM teams in another region. Begin with small step!! Besides, we reach out to some open bio project to do the connection actively.\r\n\r\n20220919 we connected to the largest web3 community in Taiwan, called Demi-Human, in order to bridge the people into the DeSci world, will try to have the stage in Demi-Human discord to talk about DeSci and gitcoin!\r\n\r\n20220920 participate PlackerDAO twitter space to discuss our

		"description": "Have you ever lost a loved one?\r\n\r\nIf you have, it was probably one of the biggest pains in your life.\r\n\r\nBut imagine not knowing what happened, imagine that loved one left home one day and never came back... worldwide this is a reality for millions worldwide.\r\n\r\nMissing people shatters lives, families and communities.\r\n\r\nReunited is an awarded project at ETH Mexico developed as a decentralized (peer-to-peer) easy-to-use solution to help people find their missing loved ones.\r\n\r\nAfter ETH Mexico we have decided to bring this project to life as a DAO and partner with stakeholders in the space to help people everywhere in the world find missing people. But we can't do it without donors to help cover the costs of infrastructure and support those working to help find missing people.\r\n\r\nThe problem.\r\n\r\nMissing people is the result of wars, conflicts, human rights abuses, natural\/human-made disasters, organized crime, trafficking, drug violence, migration, among other factors.\r\n\r\nThe International Commission of Missing People acknowledges the huge challenge that represents having reliable databases; information is scattered, unreliable, outdated and in many cases even censured.\r\n\r\nWhen a person goes missing there is a huge psychological, physical and economic damage for all parties involved; the missing, the families and the communities.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of peace, truth, justice, reparations, mental health, security, economy, migration, equality and other topics. It can be also viewed from a discriminatory perspective on gender, origins, race, sexual preference and social class.\r\n\r\nThousands of people go missing every day.\r\n\r\nIt's not overstated that missing people shatter lives, families and communities.\r\n\r\nThe solution.\r\n\r\nWe have developed a functioning prototype platform that allows people to report missing people in a simple way. Information is stored on the blockchain making it transparent, uncensorable and easily accessible. Yet information will be encrypted to avoid bad actors. Finally, we have a system that allows those who might have found a missing person to frame them with a camera device to compare it with the database using an Artificial Intelligence system to try to find a match.\r\n\r\nKey Benefits:\r\n\r\n+ Inclusive. Available worldwide and easy to use (you only need an email, password, data and photo of the missing person.\r\n\r\n+ Decentralized. A P2P database to help scale efforts to match unidentified people with missing people. Furthermore, making it permissionless may help this grow more than any current system.\r\n\r\n+ Immutable. This database can be tempered by any government or third party.\r\n\r\nUse cases.\r\n\r\n+ Vulnerable communities: Help kids, migrants, disabled, victims of traffic and other vulnerable people get back home and reunited with their loved ones.\r\n\r\n+ Unidentified diseased. Help families get certainty closure and reunite with the remaining of their loved ones.\r\n\r\n+ Missing pets. Potentially we could customize the software to help find other species, like cats & dogs.\r\n\r\nUse of funds.\r\n\r\n250 USD monthly to cover costs of infrastructure (servers, software, etc)\r\n7500 USD to bring this prototype into a fully functional system that may provide this service to thousands.\r\nAdditional resources will be used to create a treasury and compensate contributors of the DAO.",

		"description": "About\r\nPOCA\r\nProof of climate and community action\r\n\r\nA POCA is like a POAP but for climate and community action.\r\n\r\nIt  is a reward badge to add to a collection of actions you participated in, whether it is building a community or taking part in a climate action.\r\n\r\nIt activates and rewards people who are taking action in the current social justice and climate crises, whether it is building, creating, protesting or participating in citizen initiatives. The current economic system rewards those who are destroying the planet.\r\n\r\nCan we activate more people to take action in the current climate and social justice crisis? And can we create a mini reward system to thank and incentivize people for doing so? How can we build community among Climate activists, artists, entrepreneurs, public benefit companies, in short, to paraphrase Kevin Owocki in Green Pill podcast #21 on Impact Certificates:\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can we create a world in which everyone is creating a positive impact [in our case, Climate Impact] and getting rewarded for doing it?\u201d\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the POAP, and experiencing the eagerness and motivation it brings to do more work and attend more meetings, we came up with the idea of a POCA \u2026 a proof of climate action.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe can only dream of a network of coffeeshops, local grocery shops, hostels, co-working spaces to start offering discounts to active citizens showing their collection of POCAs, growing the community support by rewarding action.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople build their collection of POCA\u2019s, as a proof of participation in climate and community action, as part of a global community.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat will this look like?\r\nLike POAPs, the organiser of an action or initiative creates the POCA, that participants can claim and add to their collection. Registrations would be decentralised, but with a quality check from a rotating team. We can create a peer-to-peer approval of the project registering.\r\n\r\nA map or website would show all the different initiatives, all over the world, visualizing the climate and social justice movement, making it possible for people to join existing initiatives and be inspired.\r\n\r\nHow it is starting\r\nFor the GR15 All for Climate issues a POCA with a unique design. All Climate-tagged projects can claim an All For Climate GR15 POCA. This Proof of Climate\/Community Action can be combined with other POCAs to show that you\u2019ve created a positive climate impact in the world through various actions. \r\n\r\nWe want to build from this idea to create reward system that is not only used in web3, but can create a community amongst all people taking action.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nFridays for Future organises an action, all activists that feel like claiming a POCA can do this.\u00a0\r\nGitcoin Grants: GR15 issues a POCA with unique design for this round, all tagged participants in projects can claim a POCA\r\nCompanies: A company organises a fun event for the climate (e.g. a crowdfunding event for climate, an action to raise awareness, a course, a \u2026\r\nCitizens: local collective of neighbours starts a community garden and creates a POCA\u00a0\r\nAyowecca Uganda organising a weekly tree planting, helpers can claim their POCA\u2019s\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\nCan we build this in a way that it is also possible to store POCA\u2019s not using blockchain?\r\nCan we guarantee privacy if needed and wanted (e.g. for rebels getting arrested and wanting to keep their name out of the picture)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Dottyland is building a community of on-chain Impact Selves with the goal of empowering 7.7bln consumers to help halt the climate crisis.\r\n\r\nThe community will reward its members for off- and on-chain climate-positive actions and turn these into functional and serviceable identities across web3 applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3f What does this mean?\r\n\r\nThink of it this way - each action that an individual takes to either refrain from harming the planet or to improve regeneration has value. Today, however, we are not able to transparently record that value nor its creator and therefore the given value holds low significance in our consumer economies since we cannot utilise it as an asset.\r\nIn order for this model to be reversed, our individual impact must become part of our on-chain dynamic and user-controlled identities, aka our Impact Selves. The Impact Self is built on a unique formula deduced impact score. \r\nWe hold the hypothesis that the better your impact score, the better your credit behaviour. A parallel for this is a modern version of your credit score (but owned and controlled by you) that will enable further use cases which set individual climate-positive impact as the quantifier for access, better terms\/conditions, higher yield.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf3f The ultimate success of the Impact Self will be measured in the improvement of the impact score. I.e. individual reduced negative impact and increased positive impact that is incentivised by ever-increasing use cases \ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf3f\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3f Where we are today: \r\n\r\nSept 2022 - we are building a social signalling solution that also serves as user-controlled reputation assessment model as an MVP use-case and expanding the core contributing community during EthOnline for proof of concept. This paves our way towards gathering data for proving the correlation between impact score and credit behaviour.\r\nFor the purpose of this proof of concept, we are starting with tracking on-chain carbon token retirement but will be expanding this shortly after to include off-chain consumer dollars to carbon as step 2. \r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3f Funding from the grants round will allow us to:\r\n\r\n-Expand the field of off- and on-chain behavioural impact data input sources\/integrations\r\n-Build out the on-chain Impact Self further from the MVP so as to enable more functionality, ecosystem integrations and encourage external use cases (incl. incentivisation models).\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3f By early 2023 we will:\r\n\r\n-Have launched the public minting of Impact Self identity\r\n-Launched public beta of Impact Self social signalling use case serving as user-controlled reputation assessment model\r\n-Built a core contributor community (and associated incentive mechanism) building in the open\r\n-Be in a position to connect the Impact Selves into a self-generating tokenized network\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3f Lastly, you might ask who the hell do we think we are to be addressing something this insane? \r\n\r\nDottyland co-founders, Ketly and K\u00e4rri met working at a consumer fintech in Tallinn (look it up, it\u2019s the fintech hotspot of the world \ud83d\ude09). Having spent their careers literally incentivising people to buy more, it hit them that they could be using their knowledge for the opposite - to truly incentivise individual climate-positive actions (including buying less) on mass scale. The team has since grown and includes contributors from across web3 and web2 backgrounds (incl token design and modelling, SaaS growth, fintech engineering, dApps, CEX engineering, environmental data analytics and more).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do reach out if you have any questions or ideas about what we\u2019re doing or, even better, feel like joining us!\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and supporting us! \r\nK\u00e4rri, Dottyland co-founder\r\nkarri@dotty.app \/\/ Karri#7506",

		"description": "Starknet.id aims to be the naming service of starknet, but more than that we aim to be an all in one identity service.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems\r\n\r\nDigital identity: At the moment, there are no protocol that provides a real digital identity, what we mainly see is domain name and subdomain.\r\n\r\nWhat if we go further ?\r\n\r\nAirdrop hunters and bots are now everywhere and it becomes more and more difficult to make the difference between engaged users and well coded bots. This example shows that Web3 protocols and Dapps need a decentralized identity tool to identify and reward their real users.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStarknet.id solutions\r\n\r\nDigital Identity vision : Starknet.id aims to be the naming service of starknet, but it\u2019s not only that.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe grand vision behind starknet.id is that someday, in a society where web3 has permeated the mainstream, a person\u2019s starknet.id can provide a reliable and comprehensive \u201cdigital identity\u201d, in contrast to the unreliable self-issued credentials that we decorate our LinkedIn pages and job resumes with.\r\n\r\nCurrently we want to focus on the starknet ecosystem, our goal is to build a decentralized identity service that can be used by all the starknet protocols to identify and reward their real users. To be eligible for rewards users only need to mint their free starknet.id that can be linked with all the off-chain services that are generally used in the crypto ecosystem (discord, twitter and github).\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a use case example :\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe developer bobby.stark contributes to the starknet ecosystem by writing some useful code.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo reward him the foundation can give him money, but can also give him a SBT (non transferrable NFT) that proves that his work was a success. This SBT could then act as reference on his digital resume.\r\n\r\nIt works with dev contributions but possibilities are endless :\r\n\r\n Education: Those who cannot afford an expensive university degree can prove their educational credentials through SBTs displayed on their starknet.id and obtained from avenues of informal learning\u00a0\r\n Banking: Loan applicants can prove their trustworthiness through the absence of bad credit history, or by showcasing their good reputation through an SBT collection, removing the need for capital-inefficient overcollaterization models commonly used in DeFi (Upon repayment of the loan, another SBT could be issued as proof of repayment)\r\n Governance: DAOs can improve their collective decision-making systems by safeguarding against whales (you can\u2019t buy a SBT). DAOs can also avert a tyranny of the majority consensus through a more inclusive voting system design by issuing SBTs to trusted outsiders.\r\n\r\n(these examples comes from bankless)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENS improvements: To prevent homograph attacks (that are possible on ENS), the starknet.id team created our own encoding that permits to be cheaper and to whitelist a certain number of characters. We also think that UX\/UI have to be drastically improved.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe will use account abstraction features permitted by starknet that will allow crypto mobile friendly experience.\r\n2021 adoption was massively driven by collectibles NFTs. We were inspired by their work and we made a cool style where each identity has a unique avatar (easy to share on social media and very visual).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Do you want to use crypto to support an entrepreneur in building their business? Probably somewhere in Africa or a developing country? We are creating a new program leveraging the existing GoodDollar ecosystem, allowing existing receivers of UBI to donate their funds towards entrepreneurs who create businesses who accept GoodDollars as payment.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBe part of their journey and follow the stories of crypto entrepreneurs growing their businesses, creating utility for crypto payments, and educating their communities about crypto as part of the process.\r\n\r\nAll raised funds on GitCoin will go directly to entrepreneurs! (Our team memers will build the required functionality in their free time, or as part of other paid gigs.)\r\n\r\nBuilding an accessible, efficient and transparent financial system starts with challenging some popular beliefs. These include poverty being a personal choice, people not being able to manage their finances, and a job being a sure way out of poverty. GoodDollar has already deployed a free-to-use digital currency (UBI) and we are now encouraging and creating new opportunities to either donate it to entrepreneurs, or support them directly by buying their goods and services.\r\n\r\nThere are so many creative, talented and skilled individuals in developing countries. People who make a living and run businesses with very little support from authorities and the formal financial sector. From backroom rentals to hair salons and catering, to selling doughnuts or airtime, these are individuals who are true entrepreneurs in every sense of the word. We want to show that crypto can be a way out of poverty and financial repression. By offering a grant available to all entrepreneurs we hope to open up the floodgates to creativity and entrepreneurship, creating even more opportunities for learning and business.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRoadMap:\r\n1. Discovery and Design - In progress.\r\n2. Entrepreneurs \u201cbatch 1\u201d sign up - September\r\n3. Quadratic funding smart contract designed - October\r\n4. Audit complete, Mainnet launch - November\r\n5. Entrepreneurs \u201cbatch 1\u201d rewarded - November\r\n6. Monthly cadence of evaluation and quadratic rewards - December\r\n\r\nKey Objectives:\r\n1. Grassroots Organization: Organize ambassadors and entrepreneurs themselves to lead the movement at a local level, grounding the work in the local experiences of micro-entrepreneurs and creators.\r\n2. Thought Leadership: Practically illustrate how to create crypto utility on a massive scale through local businesses, onboarding previously disadvantaged groups into Web3 at scale and educate local communities on basic income using stories and evidence generated by the pilot.\r\n3. Charitable giving: Providing a real opportunity to donate to local entrepreneurs in a simple, effective and trustless manner. No need to choose who to give to, as the quadratic formula will take care of that and funds will only go to real businesses providing real utility.\r\n\r\nThree user types \/ Nine use cases:\u00a0\r\na) Entrepreneurs: 1. Sign up to be a part of the program through a typeform. Provide business name, wallet address and basic info. Choose if you want to be public on our website, and if so then also provide some more details like a logotype. 2. Sell goods and services, receive funds into your wallet for a month. 3. The following month you\u2019ll see quadratically matched donations coming into your wallet, no other admin required.\r\n\r\nb) Donors: 4. Donate through GitCoin or 5. Transfer funds directly to our payment-splitter smart contract.\r\n\r\nc) DAO: 6. At the end of the month evaluate all participating wallets based on how many unique payors and how much value received, then determine quadratic matching percentages. 7. Move funds from GitCoin to the payment-splitter. 8. Adjust the payment-splitter settings for according to the new percentages as determined by quadratic matching formula.\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nDirect cash transfers to entrepreneurs: 100.00% of grants\r\nDesign, develop & test, operations, marketing, etc: 0.00% of grants\r\n",

The funds raised will be solely used for the development of this module. \r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhase 1 Gameplay and Features\r\n\r\nMonsters and creatures lurk across the Realms Eternum, in search of fresh human blood to feast on and eventually the Lich King will dominate mankind.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nMonsters randomly spawn across the 8,000 Realms\r\nThey feast on Troops & Adventurers to grow in strength and power\r\nValuable Resources are plundered when Monsters win the battle against Troops & Adventurers\r\nTroops & Adventurers gain Morale and Resources when they successfully slay Monsters\r\nTime decay for Monsters during days of inactivity\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhase 2 Gameplay and Features\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe battlefield was a scene of utter carnage. Adventurers and troops perished as Monsters pillage their homes and destroy their fortresses.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nTroops & Adventurers can assemble party attacks on Monsters\r\nMonsters group together to raid on Troops & Adventurers\r\nMonsters concoct new Resources to create new dens, hideouts, weaponries and armouries\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhase 3 Gameplay and Features\r\n\u00a0\r\nLich King is resurrected from the depths of Hell and unleashed its fury on the entire Realmsverse. Will Mankind survive this ordeal to emerge stronger or is this the end of the World?\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nQuarterly event where World Boss such as a Lich King is resurrected from the depths of Hell.\r\nTroops and Adventurers band together regardless of which Order they belong to.\r\nSlayer of the World Boss will be bestowed an Ancient Relic.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\n\u00a0\r\nMonsters are player-controlled, this greatly expands the user base and gives rise to a whole new dimension of gameplay with countless variables. They are minted directly on StarkNet to allow real-time and on-chain gameplay.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nTypes of Monsters\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFAQ\r\n\u00a0\r\n1. When will Monsters launch?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe gameplay mechanics are not set in stone and we are in constant discussion with BibliothecaDAO. Game balancing is the key to success and we are targeting to roll out Phase 1 beta version by Q4 2022.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n2. What is the total supply of Monsters?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis is to be determined together with BibliothecaDAO as this is a key aspect of the game balancing.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n3. Why are you building on Realms Eternum?\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe have benefitted greatly from the Lootverse and Realms Eternum ecosystem. We believe creating more utilities for this ecosystem is the best way of giving back to this community.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n4. What is the technology used to build Monsters?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe smart contracts will be built using Cairo and will be deployed directly on StarkNet.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n5. I love this idea! How can I help?\r\n\u00a0\r\nFeel free to get into the Realms discord and get in touch with Aralekor#0010 or velarXneo#8711\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress and Schedule\r\n15-Sep-2022: We are continuously going through the repo of Realms to understand the architecture. While waiting for @loaf to merge their latest changes for a working v1, we have managed to get some moving parts up and running. See below screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are in constant discussions with BibliothecaDAO to draft out the final module requirements.\r\n\r\n",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7463\/a-web3-approach-to-repetition-learning-introducin",
		"description": "Our space has reached an interesting point. The content is there, yet everyday people still have to endure a lot of friction to get involved in crypto and web3. We believe the secret to onboarding doesn't lie solely in better UX, but better pathways to contribution.\r\n\r\nThat's why we set out to build the simplest possible introduction to crypto. Leaving most of the techy mumbo-jumbo aside and focusing exclusively on the stuff you need to learn to get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy encouraging curiosity and giving you the tools to start exploring, we believe our approach can get your uncle\/aunt, cousin or sibling signing transactions and minting NFTs in the span of a dinner table conversation.\r\n___\r\n\r\nWhat is Repetition Learning?\r\nWhat do Duolingo, Brilliant, Codecademy, and hundreds of other learning apps all have in common? They make learning fun and habitual by harnessing repetition learning.\r\nThis learning technique seeks to strengthen memory retention by encouraging the learner to re-visit and re-learn the core contents of any lesson. This has been proven to enable lightning fast mastery of any given topic, given the experience is fun enough for the user to keep on coming. We believe we've cracked the code in that aspect.\r\n\r\nAs we said in our opening line, the content is there. But how often do you come back to a 3-page instructional guide? Repetition learning seeks to break complex topics into bite-sized chunks that can be revisited over and over as needed, allowing for a deeper and more engaged understanding of the lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn top of that, we also took a particular approach to further learning paths for our Candidates. We offer them the very basics they need to know, but also make sure to point them in the right direction with curated sources if they wish to go down their rabbit hole of choice.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis easy onboarding mechanic aims to nurture the mindset of curiosity that will end up making all of the difference in the long run. By making the initial experience less stressful and more of a leisurely learning path, we can ensure our participants will gain confidence and explore deeper down the web3 ecosystem at their own pace.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSo, let's get to the good stuff. Allow us to introduce you to the Astronaut Candidate (ASCAN) training, a highly curated and hand crafted onboarding experience that trims the crypto-knowledge fat as much as possible. Average users don't need to know how a platform works at the protocol level, they just need a wallet and some ETH to start participating in our ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's more, we offer them a specific mission to work towards from the get-go, in the shape of their first free NFT, which they'll just need to complete a few lessons to get. By driving their intention and rewarding their curiosity, we'll make sure they know everything they (truly) need to become active participants in web3.\r\n\r\nThese NFTs will have no monetary value, and will be soul-bound to the candidates\u2019 wallet. We\u2019re not about giving people another reason to speculate, quite the contrary. These tokens will serve the key purpose of data points from which our more ambitious endeavors will spring . As a way of linking up a full entryway into our space, after launch, we\u2019ll be focusing significant efforts on finding and consolidating key partnerships with other beginner-oriented projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may involve special access, ELI5 events with key players in the DeFi, L2, and DAO space; as well as some potential future experiments aimed at demonstrating how web3 is good for much, much more than just the speculatory and financial. Beyond that, the NFT makes for a beautiful memory of the user's first foray into web3.\r\n\r\nMore than anything we aim to make the entry barrier for web3 as low as possible and make it an enjoyable and positive experience for the user - and also making sure they are safe on their way once they start to venture off into their own communities and projects.\r\n\r\nWhy go for a Grant?\r\nWe\u2019ve been building this course out of sheer passion for the past few months, paying for development out of pocket, and spending long nights tweaking the core experience to offer a truly approachable gateway into crypto. The time has come to scale our idea into what it can truly become, and we would love your support in expanding and realizing this vision to its full potential.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not in a position to offer your financial support through this grant, we absolutely understand, but there are plenty of ways to help out! We'd be happy to talk about any potential partnerships, and even just a nice DM can help us a lot! \ud83d\ude42\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re looking to grow and develop in the following areas specifically:\r\n\r\nPorting the course to a mobile app\r\nDesigning our future courses (protocol and platform partnerships)\r\nCommunity building for web3 newcomers\r\nSocial media (looking at you, chief meme officers)\r\nSybil resistance against course completion by \u201cairdrop farmers\u201d\r\n\r\nThe core lessons of our project are only the tip of the iceberg, the MVP. We want to eventually extend our infrastructure of easy-to-start \u201ccourse-lets\u201d (if that\u2019s even a word) to anyone looking to share a complex message in an easy to digest manner. So much of web3 passes unnoticed nowadays just for the lack of a clear way to communicate its value, we can help with that.\r\n\r\nJoin us in our dream of making web3 accessible to everyone, not through quantity but quality. Even if we end up just helping a single person dive into our space, we'll feel like our mission was successful. We're simple like that: one step at a time.\r\n\r\nReady for Lift-off.\r\n\r\nWe have already completed all of our lessons and are working on launching the experience for the masses, free of charge, as soon as possible. Just a few nuts and bolts to tighten before the first iteration of ASCAN goes live.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe core product is already here, we will be launching it soon no matter what. Still, there's still so much to cover for the knowledge resource we plan on eventually becoming, that's where you fit in.\r\n\r\nWe're looking to expand our curriculum, and include laser-focused pathways into web3, no matter your level of tech literacy. Besides that, we also dream of one day porting our web experience into its own mobile app, to meet our people where they stand.\r\n\r\nFor now, we're working on two big undertakings in the medium term:\r\n\r\nLaunching the Course App: ASCAN can only really achieve its full potential if the experience can be felt in a mobile-native way. Our end goal is to build an app that can be accessed from every mobile device in the world, even without an internet connection. This also involves growing our curriculum to include lessons beyond the essentials. Covering topics from decentralized social to L2s.\r\n\r\nCreating a Course Builder: As part of that end goal, we also plan to open up access to our platform for interesting projects and protocols in the space. Allowing them to craft their own easy to grasp mini-courses to help us make web3 learning less of a challenge for newcomers. Down the line, the course builder will allow you to explain your complex DeFi protocol or ecosystem in just a few slides, as easily as you'd make a Canva presentation.\r\n\r\nThe sky's the limit from there. We don't currently plan on launching a token (besides the free NFTs) or establishing any type of DAO structure, we'll let the needs of the project dictate how we scale. For now, we're more than happy to share the news, and full access to the course soon enough, with you.\r\n\r\nIf this project resonates with you and you know someone who'd appreciate an easy introduction to web3, you'd be doing us an amazing favor by sharing this referral link. We promise to take good care of them.\r\n\r\nYou can try out the experience in this Figma link",

		"description": "We just won Polygon Buidlit Hackathon Public Good Track Prize!\r\n\r\nInspiration\r\nWhen we say that an Ethereum account has been lost, it refers to two cases:\r\nThe owner forgets the private key, which means the assets are permanently lost.\r\nThe owner leaks the private key, which means anyone with the private key can act the same as the original account owner.\r\nOur project aims to protect account owners of the latter case, which is very dangerous: the account owner loses the exclusive right to use the account, which indicates the account is not secure anymore.\r\nFor leaked accounts, DApps should be aware of them on time to protect the original owners of these accounts. For example, when one reports that her account is leaked:\r\nMulti-signature wallets (e.g.,\u00a0Gnosis Safe) should ban this account.\r\nWeb3 email providers (e.g.,\u00a0MetaMail) in which users log in with signatures should suspend everybody's access to emails of this account to protect the privacy of the original owner.\r\nElectronic agreements based on ETH accounts (e.g.,\u00a0ETHSign) should disqualify this account from signing new agreements. Because the new agreements signed may not be authorized by the original owner.\r\nTo solve the above problems, we propose the\u00a00xdeadlist.io\u00a0project to maintain a list of addresses whose private keys have been leaked. By rewarding the burier NFT (Non-fungible token), 0xDeadList encourages users and hackers to report accounts with leaked private keys, and stores the information of these leaked accounts on the chain to facilitate DApps project parties to query these insecure accounts.\r\nWhat it does\r\n0xDeadList\u00a0is a\u00a0public good\u00a0that encourages users to collect and report addresses whose private keys are leaked. Users can directly log in to\u00a00xdeadlist.io\u00a0to report the leaked address. The\u00a0main contract\u00a0of 0xDeadList provides two steps (lock address\u00a0and\u00a0bury address) to report leaked addresses under the following considerations:\r\nPreventing the reporter's NFT reward from being stolen by\u00a0front-running attacks.\r\nEnsuring the reporter has enough time before the private key of the leaked address is fully disclosed.\r\nIn step 1, the reporter locks the address to be buried, and the contract records the address of the reporter. At this time, the private key of the locked address will not be disclosed.\r\nIn step 2, the user uploads the private key of the locked address in step 1, and the reporter address recorded in the contract will receive an NFT reward, indicating that the address is buried, and the buried (or say, leaked) address will receive a tombstone SBT (Soul Bound Token), which is not transferable. In step 2, the private key of the buried address will be made public (recorded on-chain), ensuring the leaked address is indeed leaked.\r\nThe 0xDeadList project is fully open-sourced, and here are some resources:\r\nWebsite:\u00a0https:\/\/0xdeadlist.io\r\nGitHub:\u00a0https:\/\/github.com\/0xDeadList\r\nContracts:\u00a00x59451a98d772f2a53ca2241a884b1703f8c55218\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But web3 will unlock this. Content is abundant and growing fast. Think about resources like YouTube, course platforms like Udemy and Coursera and internal solutions like Notion.\r\nThe current online knowledge and learning programs, however, are created as standalone resources in proprietary platforms and are not designed to be shared, nor for other humans to be available to provide guidance in an efficient and rewarding way. And they are definitely not designed to be upgradable by a larger audience (Wikipedia style).\r\nCommunity managers have difficulties creating content and guidance for new roles and keeping up to date with changes in their fields.\r\nA learner can\u2019t customize to their current needs the learning content provided, let alone practice the skills and learn from their mistakes.\r\nExperts and creators are not rewarded correctly, whether the reward is recognition or money.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe solution\r\nPatica is a digital learning platform based on a knowledge graph and focused on personal learning and human guidance, to adapt online education to web3 challenges and today\u2019s needs:\r\nPersonal learning is the type of learning where the learner takes responsibility & ownership, creates and curates the learning journey, and defines the definition of success.\u00a0\r\nHuman guidance is where a human with domain knowledge helps the learning: coach, advisor, assessor, etc. Help with the curation of the learning journey or the assessment of the success of learning.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe users\r\nOur target users are not only purpose organizations & their stakeholders (contributors and\/or beneficiaries), but also everyone who is willing to learn new skills to reach their own objectives.\u00a0\r\n\r\nImagine Juan. \r\nHe wants to turn his organization into a DAO, but he has no idea how to do.\r\nThanks to Patica, Juan created his own tailored learning program, from DAO fundamentals to governance and treasury. He talked to experts on the way and got feedback on his plans to successfully launch the DAO.\r\nHe also contributed to enrich and update the knowledge graph, extended his network and connected with other supporting communities.\r\n\r\nImagine Lisa. \r\nShe would like to monetize her long experience in DAOs and tokenomics.\r\nWith Patica, she forked an existing program, enriched the knowledge graph with new material and embedded it in her website. A learner, Juan, contacted her with a clear objective. She advised him on best material and shared her experience for a successful DAO.\r\nShe had a real impact and got rewarded for her expertise. And Juan and her may want to partner up to work on a new project.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSome functionalities\u00a0\r\nContent will be presented through a knowledge graph where content will be linked to each other though metadata, most likely relying on OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph architecture.\r\nOn their dashboard, users will have the possibility to create learning paths by linking actions (curated content) and decision boxes (choices to make to progress).\r\nThe user-facing part of Patica will eventually have many form factors:\u00a0\r\nWeb application\r\nWeb embedding code\r\nBrowser extension\r\nChat bot > Slack \/ Discord\r\nMobile application\r\n\u00a0\r\nGo to market strategy\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first, Patica will co-create the initial learning programs with starter communities. These programs will include general and community\/expert specific content.\u00a0\r\n\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In parallel, Patica will design and build the stack: front-end and back-end of the first dApp. This will allow users and communities to share, search and fork learning programs from other users and communities. It will also allow them to reach and interact with experts willing to guide learners on these programs. These experts can come from within their community, be invited to participate from outside, or come from other communities.\r\n\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is the part that talks to the knowledge graph and handles the transactions, to pay other infrastructure in the network and\/or the creators of programs and experts.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMarket Potential & roadmap\r\nThe global e-learning market was worth USD 215 billion in 2021.

We\u2019ve been a leader in DeSci since 2019, with more than 8000 members, 450 open science projects and 20 communities and 3 major programs (COVID, Cancer and Vaccination) on our platform so far.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJOGL currently has two main missions: (1) provide a free digital platform for people to connect and collaborate on open science projects and (2) create giant community-driven laboratories that are dedicated to building open source solutions for critical problems (e.g. antimicrobial resistance or plastic waste).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 Objectives of this grant:\r\n\r\nJOGL has been a web2-based platform since its launch in 2019 and the purpose of this grant is to support the web3fication of the JOGL platform. Our goal is to offer one of the best hubs for DeSci, bridging web2 and web3 Open Science communities.\r\nAs we are starting this new journey into web3, we need support from the web3 and DeSci communities. We are initially seeking 10000-30000 dollars to help us create the right dynamic around the project. Ultimately, we estimate that at least 300000 dollars will be needed to transform JOGL into a web3 DeSci machine and even more to achieve our vision of a planet-sized laboratory.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe also have two other Gitcoin grants running under the DeSci banner: \r\nA Giant Lab for better diagnostic solutions for neglected diseases\r\nA Giant Lab for better solutions for antibiotic resistance\r\n\r\n\u2728 The vision so far:\r\n\r\nWhy there is value in bringing JOGL on web3:\r\nOpening the web3 DeSci door to many new people. JOGL will make it easy for its current community (8000+ users + Institutional partners) to create and associate a wallet to their account.\u00a0\r\nMaking JOGL compatible with the many exciting web3 DeSci tools being built.\u00a0\r\nProviding tools to more efficiently capture the value created a given community (DAO model)\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd2c Budget:\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith this grant, we will be able to:\r\nStudy how to best bridge web2 and web3 for our users and partners. We will share publicly all our reflexion and conclusions in order to inspire other founders\r\nFund a team of UX designers and web3 developers that will create the blueprint of JOGL on web3 and implement it\r\nEstablish key partnerships with web3 and DeSci actors to build a strong future for JOGL\r\n\r\nMore details:\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are building the smartest community on earth and giving it the right resources to develop solutions dedicated to the improvement of our world's well-being.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJOGL\u2019s modus operandi relies on five essential pillars:\u00a0\r\nA scalable digital open source platform capable of connecting very large numbers of stakeholders and fostering collaboration,\u00a0\r\nAn open and continuous community-based evaluation framework that offers due-diligence services to all initiatives proposed by the community,\u00a0\r\nAn agile funding model providing fast and additive microfunding (<$10k per microgrant) to initiatives positively evaluated by the community, where applicants are also reviewers,\u00a0\r\nThe creation of scientific and technological commons to facilitate egoless collaboration and faster information propagation, and\r\nA community animation dynamic that is efficient at fostering collaborations and support among all members of the community.\r\n\r\nThe JOGL platform is fully open source and free for individuals to use. With 8000+ members from 100+ countries and 450+ projects, it is already one of the most prominent spaces for community-driven science and innovation. After 3 years of development, the beta version currently enables:\u00a0\r\nPeople and organisations to establish a public profile in the space of community science and innovation\r\nPeople to connect through their common interests, skills, needs and projects.\u00a0\r\nCommunities to be mobilised around a given problem to solve collectively\r\nThe creation and management of communities around a given theme or organisation\u2019s mission.\u00a0\r\nThe due-diligence of proposals using the collective intelligence of the community\r\n\r\nWe are currently implementing the following functions:\u00a0\r\nGeo-mapping. It will enable the visualization of the physical distribution and location of a given set of objects (members of a community, organisations, laboratories\u2026)\r\nProtocols. Projects will be able to better documentate their work and share their protocols with the rest of the community much more easily.\u00a0\r\nResources. Any organisations or people will be able to declare what resources they currently possess and the ones they could share with a given community or project.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0d Giant Labs:\r\n\r\nGiant Labs are the embodiment of the JOGL approach on a specific thematic or problem. They are egoless spaces made to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders and motivated contributors, where resources and funding can be pooled and redistributed asymmetrically as additive microgrants to initiatives positively evaluated by the collective intelligence of its community. Giant Labs have several advantages compared to traditional academic labs or R&D companies. They reduce the cost of prototyping ideas by 10, they produce open knowledge and open source solutions, they are capable of supporting more risky ideas and non-traditional profiles (independants, makers, students\u2026) and they even enable the merging of similar initiatives. It\u2019s not about who comes first but how we go far together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring our OpenCOVID19 initiative, we funded 36 projects out of 150 proposals using the community review and microgrant approach (120k euros available). 22 functional solutions (diagnostic tests, medical devices, lab hardware, education programs, social science studies\u2026), and 12 scientific papers were produced which makes the JOGL model 10 times more efficient than the traditional academic and R&D models. \r\n\r\n",

This grant will help us set up the foundations for the creation of this community-driven decentralised laboratory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nObjectives of the Giant Lab:\r\n\r\nThe objective is to\u00a0\r\nDecrease the impact of neglected infectious diseases in low and middle income countries\r\nDevelop and provide low-cost, rapid and easy to use point-of-care diagnostic tests for human and animal neglected tropical diseases, especially the ones strongly connected to the environment.\u00a0\r\nAdditional key features of the tests to be developed are optimal stability\/storage (with no cold chain needed), local manufacturing and regulatory process.\u00a0\r\nAll the designs will be shared using open source licences.\r\n\r\nWe will mobilise the community around three major tracks:\u00a0\r\nIterative improvement of the diagnostic technology taking local constraints into account and adaptation to target diseases\r\nClinical validation of the tests\r\nLocal manufacturing and empowerment of local actors\r\n\r\nSo far:\r\n\r\nWe have brought together a consortium of partners (Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement, FIND, GOSH, AfricaOSH\u2026) and are seeking our first source of funding. Ultimately, we aim at a 500k dollars annual budget over 4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith this grant:\r\n\r\nWe have two initial goals for this grant: 10000 dollars and 30000 dollars. With that, we will:\r\nMobilise 200+ contributors (scientists, engineers, designers, NGOs\u2026)\u00a0\r\nFund a few local proof of concept\r\nEstablish a network of local actors capable of local manufacturing of these tests.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\nMicrogrants [50%]\r\nIncentivizing the project holders using microgrants (up to 2000 dollars) for validated projects - this goes a long way in the global south.\r\nOrganization of two rounds (one every 3 months)\r\n\r\nJOGL Operations and Infrastructure [50%]\r\nCommunity mobilization and animation\u00a0\r\nCreation of the program flow for applicants\r\nMobilization campaign (graphics and social media)\r\nSupport to the community (community events)\r\nDigital Infrastructure Development\u00a0\r\nSupport of the continuous improvement of the JOGL open source infrastructure\r\nMaintenance of the platform\r\nFellowship and Leadership of programme\u00a0\r\nEvaluation of the community program\u00a0\r\nSharing of the observation as a public report after 1 year of activity\r\nCreation of the program flow for applicants\r\nAnalysis and sharing of peer-review results\u00a0\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n\r\nThere is a broad interest for the development of such tests in order to increase accessibility of diagnostics, especially in rural \/ remote areas. Ultimately, this will help improve data on disease prevalence on a larger scale (including secluded areas), and in the long term could lead to implementing a sustainable surveillance system.\r\n\r\nWe will do that through the creation of a decentralised research network of actors (Researchers, entrepreneurs, makers, local practitioners) capable of fast and agile collaboration for the development of low-cost and open source molecular diagnostic solutions optimised for neglected diseases in low and middle income countries (LMIC) in a One-Health context.\r\n\r\nHere are the constraints that we will be taking into account for the design of solutions:\r\nNon-invasive (saliva, urine, microvolume blood sample), adapted to the pathogen and the host\r\nLow-cost (affordable for local public health infrastructure)\r\nOpen licences for easy design sharing and cost control.\r\nEasily manufacturable locally to limit logistical cost\r\nRegulatory approval (alternative to FDA and CE)\r\nAdapted to use by non-technicians\r\nNo need for heavy equipment\r\nRoom-temperature stability for use and storage\r\n\r\nWe will use the LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification) technology as a foundational tech because:\r\n\u201cLAMP techniques, sometimes promoted as \u201cfield methods,\u201d are also very promising [144]; however, they remain in the hands of those laboratories that implemented their initial development and have never reached the stage of practical and widespread use, so they have never been really validated\u201d. https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13071-022-05190-1.pdf\r\nEasy to prototype\r\nSome patents are expired\r\nNo need for heavy equipments\r\nLow-cost\r\n\r\nWe will use the JOGL approach to structure, engage and animate the community. It relies on five pillars:\r\nA scalable digital open source platform capable of connecting very large numbers of stakeholders and fostering collaboration, currently with 8000 members from 100+ countries.\r\nAn open and continuous community-based evaluation framework that offers due-diligence services to all initiatives proposed by the community,\r\nAn agile funding model providing fast and additive microfunding (2-20k per microgrant) to initiatives positively evaluated by the community, where applicants are also reviewers,\r\nThe creation of scientific and technological commons to facilitate egoless collaboration and faster information propagation, and\r\nA community animation dynamic that is efficient at fostering collaborations and support among all members of the community.\r\n\r\nWe are aiming at making a proof of work using a simple agenda of 6 months of preparation and 1 year of facilitation with the objective of developing the first iterations of tests for a couple of diseases. If successful, the program will be strengthened and scaled to even more partners and diseases.\r\n\r\nWe will use the two following neglected diseases as targets for our proof of concept .\r\nLeptospirosis\r\nThere is currently no rapid diagnostic tests available in LMIC used as a routine test (too expensive)\r\nThe most used test is a serological one and requires heavy equipment and a lab environment with trained technicians to run it.\r\nIt is a disease that concerns as much humans as animals. Environmental contamination is often the driving factor and so must be more thoroughly studied\r\nWe need to do more surveillance in order for local governments to design better public health policies and to enable faster reaction to potential pandemic threat\r\nLAMP-based tests have been developed by labs but remain research-use only\r\nTrypanosomiasis\r\nLAMP has been tried but unsuccessful so far. There is an opportunity to prove that the community open approach can help\r\nCurrently requires two successive tests (serological and parasitological)\r\nThere are only two manufacturers of rapid tests for THA and TAA and they are occidental companies using a subvention-based model. This makes them vulnerable to any decrease in subvention and could stop production any time. Local manufacturing is a critical factor if we want sustainable local surveillance capacities.\r\nThere are several species of trypanosoma and there are no universal tests.\r\nAnimals are pathogen reservoirs\r\nThere are asymptomatic carriers (for both animal and human), we need more systematic testing\r\nThere are entire regions where we have no data and could be key reservoirs to be monitored\r\n\r\nGiant Labs are the embodiment of the JOGL approach on a specific thematic or problem. They are egoless spaces made to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders and motivated contributors, where resources and funding can be pooled and redistributed asymmetrically as additive microgrants to initiatives positively evaluated by the collective intelligence of its community. Giant Labs have several advantages compared to traditional academic labs or R&D companies. They reduce the cost of prototyping ideas by 10, they produce open knowledge and open source solutions, they are capable of supporting more risky ideas and non-traditional profiles (independants, makers, students\u2026) and they even enable the merging of similar initiatives. It\u2019s not about who comes first but how we go far together.\r\n\r\nThe Just One Giant Lab platform has hosted the creation of hundreds of open source projects, and chief among these projects are our collection and consortium of RT-LAMP tests, able to detect specific DNA fragments using custom primers, and allow for these to be visualised in an easy 20 minute time frame. What's more, we have funded the creation of genomic labs in the Philippines and started antiviral projects such as symptom related AI that scrolls through twitter, quarantine enabling apps, as well as self diagnostic apps and a web service for tracking and identifying AMR based in Africa. We have recently in the OpenCOVID19 programme : https:\/\/app.jogl.io\/program\/opencovid19 connected thousands of volunteers, and funded the best talent in an extremely efficient funding process known as microgrants to create hundreds of projects to tackle the current pandemic, many of which are based on diagnostics, but also many of which are hindered by lack of funds to take their project further in many cases.",

		"description": "PDX Regenerative Tech Commons is building a local coalition of makers to scale bioregion-appropriate technologies for a safe & sane future.\r\n\r\nAs the regenerative design\u00a0movement expands, with iterations in community finance, blockchain, agriculture, and material & organizational design, practical local implementation is the logical next step. But the task of scaling these technologies to the level of viable local infrastructure faces major logistical and cultural barriers. Extractive financial mechanisms and institutions that serve their interests still carry\u00a0mainstream narrative power, holding the mantle of realism and utility with perverse ideologies that are, at their core, irreal and anti-life. We can only respond with reality: as the wealth chase is pushed aside, it's the urgent mandate of an escalating climate crisis that will make resilient and autonomous regional infrastructure a matter of life and death. (It already has.)\r\n\r\nPortland Regenerative Technology Commons is doubling down on realism,\u00a0strategically reframing the language around technology\u00a0to embrace, as it always should have, the wide range of innovations and strategies that apply systems thinking and emergent properties to the mutual benefit of living systems. For us, any technology that implements these principles is avant garde, whether hi or lo, soil or silicon. Similarly, no matter how apparently sophisticated, we see that the technologies of extraction, surveillance and capture are lo-tech, obsolete, and irreal in their goals. When we demystify internet and distributed ledger technology, or currency and governance models, as design systems that succeed or fail in integrating harmoniously with a variety of life systems, we place them on a flat plane with technologies of soil management and food production. Those that have already made this conceptual move have found rich resonance across design systems, sparking a small renaissance of open source, decentralized and regenerative innovations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nKailash Ecovillage in Southeast Portland\r\n\r\nPortland in particular stands out as a hub for this renaissance - for decades we\u2019ve been a stronghold for experiments in open source, adequate technology, mutual aid, alternative food security and permaculture (backyard chicken coops have reached the level of cliche\u00a0in this town). We\u2019ve been home to visionaries of decentralization and regenerative thinking like Paul Stamets, Viviane Barnett, Linus Torvalds, Ursula Le Guin and Toby Hemenway, and community projects like Kailash Ecovillage (above) and Intersection Repair. Our initial members have connections with local organizations including\u00a0Depave, Oregon Just Transition Alliance, City Repair, and Friends of Trees, alongside some of the broader existing permaculture, community organizing, and mutual aid communities around the city. As a city, we have the space, resources, and established community organizations to do tech-enhanced bioregionalism the right way.\r\n\r\nAt Portland Regenerative Technology Commons, we intend to be a community space, work area and event venue for all of these energies, with an emphasis on regenerative and community-oriented finance (including #ReFi, LETS, cooperative and mutual credit models), open design\/open hardware, distributed ledger and DAO tech, Ostromian commons management, alternative food supply and urban permaculture. We see these as the core technologies that will be needed to build a decentralized, regenerative bioregional infrastructure that can ensure our community\u2019s safety in the face of crisis and breakdown, while providing another strategic example in localism for the global experiment in degrowth and regeneration.\r\n\r\nWe have been inspired to this task by the global Regen web3 movement - the Crypto Commons Hub and Regens Unite stand out as examples for some of the first experiments in IRL localized movement building in the space. We also draw  guidance of vision from the local multi-racial coalitions of environmental justice like Oregon Just Transition Alliance and Coalition of Communities of Color. We hope to build a community that can maintain and empower regenerative solutions and projects in Cascadia, including those that have been fighting for decentralization and autonomy decades before the inception of blockchain technology. Our grant will benefit the entire web3 Public Goods ecosystem by continuing the process of localizing this movement, bridging the local-global gap between crypto regens and the many communities fighting for justice and systems resilience, and creating a space where can develop strategies, share knowledge and experiment with adequate community coordination for the 21st century. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Specific Near Term Goals:\r\n\r\nEstablish the Portland Regenerative Technology Cooperative to provide services for reliable income flow and stage floating meetings as an organizational wing of the commons.\r\n\r\nLease a brick and mortar space on Portland\u2019s Eastside. Our current intention is to sign a year lease with\u00a0this 1,079 foot flex space\u00a0in the Mississippi neighborhood of North Portland. The space is open air with a loft and kitchenette, making it perfect for small community gatherings, events and talks while being capable of hosting one or two travelers at a time for lodging. Nearby green space is available in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBuild relationships with and offer our space to a diverse range of community members and builders, including those in broader Cascadia who may want a home base in the city, to share work, discuss strategies, and collaborate.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe space.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "ValleyDAO is an open community collectively financing and enabling fair access to synthetic biology (SynBio) technologies to protect the future of our planet. We\u2019re utilizing a novel intellectual property (IP) framework called an IP-NFT, which enables funding, owning and transacting IP in an open and distributed market while preserving privacy and protection. In simple terms, it allows a decentralized entity like a DAO to own, curate and distribute IP. The IP-NFT framework has been validated by VitaDAO, which funds longevity and therapeutics research.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cSynBio is a toolbox that enables scientists to engineer the DNA of microorganisms to sustainably produce - among other things - cultured meats and textiles, and capture carbon directly from the air and convert it into value-added products such as food-proteins and biofuels.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt ValleyDAO, we are a group of academics, entrepreneurs, IP experts, business developers and solarpunks who believe in the power of SynBio technologies as a promising solution to combat climate change.\r\n\r\nWhy ValleyDAO?\r\n\r\nThe degree to which the SynBio technologies and know-how can be accessed could soon determine the fate of economies. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, outrageously prices therapeutics and treatments while leaving no room for competition, thanks to their rampant abuse of the traditional patenting system. We need a better system to make sure our medicines, the very food we eat, and access to energy and materials, among other things, do not fall victim to hyper-corporatization in the future. To truly unleash the power of SynBio, we\u2019ll need an innovation ecosystem that fosters collaboration over competition and democratized access over centralized control of IP. Our goal is to create this ecosystem through ValleyDAO.\r\n\r\nThe ValleyDAO Ecosystem\r\n\r\nTo create a self-sustaining ecosystem, we\u2019ll need a mechanism for value creation followed by value capture. Our ecosystem accomplishes just that using a three-part system shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The researchers submit their project ideas to ValleyDAO and have them funded if they pass the due-diligence process and a community vote.\u00a0\r\n\r\n2. The IP generated from successful projects is either licensed to the industry or spun out into a startup with the help of ValleyDAO business development team. If appropriate, the IP is also licensed using a pay-what-you-can model for fair and open-source access.\r\n\r\n3. Finally, the proceeds, as royalty payments or startup equity, go back into the treasury which enables ValleyDAO to fund new research projects.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to mention that ValleyDAO\u2019s assets - IP, equity, licensing revenues, etc. - are ultimately managed by a community of token-holders. This ensures that the decisions involving funding and IP licensing are as democratized as possible.\r\n\r\nIn other words, ValleyDAO acts as a startup creation studio and as a democratized IP generating engine with a fair pricing model built into it. This ensures that the researchers are rewarded for their efforts and vital SynBio technologies are not gatekept, but are made available to the industry, entrepreneurs, and other researchers who might want to integrate them into their work. An open ecosystem ultimately drives faster adoption and innovation. The open source software industry is a case in point.\r\n\r\nAccomplishments and Roadmap\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of Funds\r\n\u00a0\r\nAll proceeds from the Gitcoin grant will go towards funding the first IP-NFT\/research project, which is led by Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro at Imperial College London. His research group will use the funds to develop an improved platform technology for the sustainable production of fats and oils using microorganisms. The use cases for these products are endless, ranging from palm oil to biofuels.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your support!\r\n\u00a0\r\nCore Team\r\n\u00a0\r\nHamza Qureshi: Former founder in the clean energy space.

		"description": "OpenCampus provides the essential resources and motivation for scientific research and studies and allows interdisciplinary collaborations with its inspiring environment. It is a co-living and co-working space for scientists, Web3.0 communities, designers, and digital nomads. OpenCampus is now evolving into a DAO-based Re-Fi and De-Sci project.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IT WAS STARTED\r\n\r\nA group of willing people related to science, technology and design from all over the world, we have been together to share our knowledge and experiences with new generations and beginners, and we have organized a 9-day camp called HacknBreak since 2016. In curation, we were inspired entirely from open source, free software, open science and open innovation cultures, and communities. These events were also an environment where the blockchain communities in Turkey came together for the first time. HacknBreak was creating a free learning environment in peace where curious people learn from each other. \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/rBPkIKB5d74\r\n\r\n\r\nWe held these activities on the land we rented in Urla, \u0130zmir. Every year we restore it with a small budget for HacknBreak while preserving its nature and biodiversity. We called this area OpenCampus.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe did it together. We can do it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past 6 years, more than 700 scientists, academics, and professionals from all over the world have volunteered in our projects and activities. In this period, we have built a community with our 15.000 event participants who came together, met, became friends, and formed various partnerships in OpenCampus. We believe it is now time to bring this network to a next level.\r\n\r\n-> OpenCampus Presentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST PLACE FOR THE LOCKDOWN TOO\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe decided to cooperate to keep OpenCampus alive, and found a cooperative called ScienceCoop. Right after founding the coop, the pandemic started. During pandemic closures, we organized dozens of free online events and bootcamps for developers, scientists and designers. (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/OpenCampusTR\/videos) We came together with small groups physically in isolated OpenCampus land, lived together, and tried sustainable agricultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic, together with our cooperative partners and a few community members, we started to think and work on some projects to make the world more resilient to climate change. Some of those;\r\n\r\n* R&D and P&D activities related to sustainable building materials resistant to earthquake and climate crises using hemp and artichoke agricultural wastes,\r\n* New planting and irrigation techniques that will reduce water and chemical fertilizer consumption against the risk of global drought.\r\n* Designing and developing a prototype of Smart Mobile Home based on BioComposite materials to minimize embodied carbon into building infrastructure.\r\n* DAO and blockchain-based industrial plantation platform w\/Chromia (C4EST - https:\/\/sciencekoop.org\/en\/c4est\/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE!\r\nOn July 17, our OpenCampus where we carry out group work on projects, come and live together and organize camps and events, was completely burned, along with the trees, materials and equipment inside, as a result of the fire that broke out in the neighboring lands. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WE WILL DO\r\n\r\nWe want to rebuild OpenCampus, the place where we will realize our projects that we have been working on for a long time. This seems like a complex problem, but we believe that it will be solved if it is rethought and redesigned with the collective mind of the community.\r\n\r\nOpenCampus in the existing land will be a pilot model for co-living and co-working places in nature where Web3.0 communities, scientists, designers and digital nomads live, use and produce. Together with the C4EST platform, we aim to spread the OpenCampus model to the other cities under the pressure of climate change in order to create large green corridors between the cities and the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that we can achieve this by creating a model based on open source and community support that can be applied in other cities with our expanding community with existing and newly added members.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine a place where like-minded people, solarpunks, geeks, ecologists, scientists etc come together in a place close to the city but green, built without using any cement, plastic-free, generating its own energy, recycling its waste?\u00a0Yes, we can imagine, and we called it OpenCampus.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOpenCampus is now evolving into a DAO-based Re-Fi and De-Sci project.

Our mission is to find and equip web3 builders of tomorrow from currently underrepresented groups.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFirst, we will form partnerships with other organizations that are targeting specific underrepresented communities (whether focused regionally, by language, by race or culture, by gender identity, etc). Our goal will be to provide support through tools, guidance, and resources, eventually building up a playbook that any similar community can use to equip and onboard a new group of people to web3. We plan to focus our initial support particularly in the area of web3 identity and credentials: helping participants build up a record of time and experience in the space.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the future we also hope to offer different sorts of \u201cexperiential learning\u201d opportunities for these communities, like apprenticeships or residencies, where they could receive an income while learning and working.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultimate phase of the project will move towards incubating new web3 projects coming from these communities: projects not necessarily focused on DEI themselves, but founded by a team from these diverse communities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe want to see many of the barriers-to-entry in web3 eroded. Our hope is that many of the underrepresented and under-capitalized groups gain the reputation to have access to 1) contributing to web3 projects, and then 2) gather teams to start web3 projects of their own.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur hope is that some of the least represented communities today can give birth to some of the most prominent and successful web3 founders of tomorrow.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy us?\r\n\r\nThe three of us met through the Hult Prize in the summer of 2021. We have experience working in nonprofits, web3, and startups. With expertise in operations, people management, and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nViktor worked in the past as Ecosystem Lead at StakerDAO and Educator at Braintrust through a grant and was recently accepted into Kernel as part of KB7 and CreatorDAO as part of the first cohort for the Creator Launchpad. Before entering Web3, he was the Event Lead for the Global Accelerator at Hult Prize and involved for 6 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLinda started her journey with social entrepreneurship by co-founding a startup back in 2017 that won best social impact award in the international competition INJAZ. Later she joined the Hult Prize Foundation as a volunteer in her university, becoming later an intern, a regional associate, a community builder and then a regional manager. As a regional manager she managed and supervised 600+ university programs within the Europe and MENA region. She successfully led the efforts to expand the program to underrepresented regions and previous war zones such as Syria and Libya through closely working with United Nations agencies in the Middle East.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNate first met Linda and Viktor when his team Zeolife (focusing on helping smallholder farmers in Colombia), won the regional Hult Prize finals in Vienna, qualifying them for the global accelerator program. He then reconnected with Viktor while leading the \u201cWeb3 and Social Impact\u201d elective with CCS (Crypto, Culture, and Society). Nate has also been contributing to Forefront DAO since February, where he helped set up the Season 2 onboarding process, and most recently helped organize and promote their Web3 Creator Residency.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "We propose a framework for on-chain voting that can be grown by a community into a vast landscape of voting contracts. This would be beneficial to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf there was a system of voting contracts covering a wide range of possible voting types from token-weighted voting via quadratic voting to delegation, then DAOs could simply plug in rather than hard-coding yet another, say, token-weighted voting into their contracts. Plugging in would be as simple as pointing to a deployed voting contract. One can also plug out or exchange the reference from one voting contract to another. In order for this to be possible we first put forth a voting standard as an EIP. Subsequently we deploy a couple of core voting contracts as a starting point. We are in contact with two DAOs who are interested in using the framework and helping us build the system.\r\n\r\n**Update** (8th of September):\r\nI have opened a topic on the Ethereum magicians forum to discuss the EIP draft: \r\nhttps:\/\/ethereum-magicians.org\/t\/eip-draft-configurable-voting-contract\/10736 \r\n\r\n**Update** (12th of September):\r\nYour contribution will cover the deployment costs for a first batch of contracts on ethereum mainnet and polygon. We will also deploy a voting playground dapp on Polygon on the 20th of September. Anyone who interacts with the playground will have an EarlyTester NFT minted to them. Watch this space!\r\n\r\n**Update** (13th of September):\r\nWorking together with the web3 developer DAO dOrg: \r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/dOrg_tech\/status\/1569398026653020160. \r\n\r\n**Update** (20th of September)\r\nWe have deployed our first contract to Polygon. It is a voting contract registry: https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0x017d53C9CFDb6c79fc4336e5b42749D6171e7098#code\r\nThanks to everyone who contributed. In the coming days we will also deploy:\r\na participation NFT (that can be used also for testing)\r\na registrar for the voting contract registry\r\na resolver for the voting contract registry\r\ntwo or more simple voting contracts\r\na playground voting contract\r\na badge (NFT) to interact with the voting app\r\nIf those things are going well, we will also deploy some contracts to mainnet.\r\n\r\n**Update** (21st of September)\r\nWe have also deployed the voting registry on mainnet:\r\nhttps:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xC535389b5a26efEbc27811915B6d78f6C95433f7\r\nIt is a central piece of the architecture, so we are happy to have deployed it to the ethereum mainnet.\r\n\r\n**Update** (25th of September)\r\nWe have deployed the following contracts on Polygon:\r\na registrar for the voting contract registry (https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0x19C079de81C1C1C075B0C3D08B66E27398F641b8)\r\na resolver for the voting contract registry (https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0x5B6dDD4fbf59Ab342E17946D19ABa88261F3eF92)\r\nThe first voting contract (Majority vote with ERC721-token weight and quroum) (https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0xa7C183bBC8c7522115A7919fF84278Cfc9FF67f6)\r\nThe second voting contract (Another Majority vote without token weight but with quorum) (https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0xa967470C2A65CB6a9C91dAA3eE818370df2CfD82)\r\nThese contracts have all been veryfied on polygonscan. Anyone can deploy registrars or resolvers as they wish. The same holds obviously for the voting contracts. There will be more documentation on how to do this soon.

		"description": "Baddies in Tech is an organization on a mission to help women of color break into and belong in technology. Founded in 2019 by a Baddie who lacked a sense of belonging at her tech workplace, Baddies in Tech has since grown an organic community of 50K+ WOC supporting one another through our tech career journeys.\r\n\r\nCore Thesis (Mission and Vision)\r\n\r\nThroughout our three year community-building journey, we\u2019ve had the privilege to explore first-hand 3 key problems that fuel the lack of diversity and inclusion for women of color in tech.\r\n\r\nProblem #1\r\nWomen of color make up just 4-5% of people in computing roles. Our communities have been systemically denied access to tech education and work opportunities, and are currently playing catchup to onboard into Web2.\r\n\r\nProblem #2\r\nOnly 8% of women of color say it is \u201ceasy\u201d to thrive in the tech industry. We faced with un-inclusive and inequitable workplaces where we are often the only WOC on our teams, and bro-culture is the norm. As a result of this, almost 50% of female technologists leave the industry before the age of 30, further fueling the representation problem.\r\n\r\nProblem #3\r\nSharing an unspoken mission, efforts by women of color technologists (and allies) to increase representation in tech spaces are often fragmented and siloed. By working individually, we move the needle instead of moving mountains.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the above as key barriers to women of color breaking into and growing careers in Web2 and Web3. We believe we can change this narrative, and our futures, by building BiTDAO - a decentralized collective of change-makers championing representation and inclusion for women of color in tech.\r\n\r\nBy bringing together our ideas, networks, and resources under a DAO, we aim to increase the representation of women of color in computing roles to 10% by 2030.\r\n\r\nMission:\r\nTo help women of color break into and belong in technology\r\n\r\nVision:\r\nTo increase the representation of women of color in computing roles to 10% by 2030\r\n\r\nWhat progress have we made?\r\n\r\nA Trusted Brand\r\nBaddies in Tech has built a well-known brand in the DEI in tech space with our fierce focus on amplifying the experiences and voices of women of color technologists. As a grassroots movement with culture and representation at its heart, we are trusted name amongst current and aspiring tech professionals and are well positioned to encourage mass adoption of Web3 technologies by women of color.\r\n\r\nAn Inclusive Discord community\r\nWe\u2019ve built a safe space in Discord for 1.5k+ Baddies to connect and uplift one another through our tech career journeys. Built to be a welcoming and inclusive environment, our Discord server is a digital home for the Baddies in Tech community to share experiences, advice, resources and mentorship.\r\n\r\nA Mentorship Program\r\nOur mentorship program has connected a cohort of aspiring tech baddies to mentors who can help them break into tech. We\u2019ve seen amazing engagement from the mentors and mentees, and are working to expand the program to curate mentorship matches for as many community members as possible!\r\n\r\nOnline + IRL Events\r\nBaddies in Tech has curated numerous online educational, recruiting and networking events for the community over the pandemic years. Recently we held our first IRL event in Atlanta, GA at the Render ATL conference. Baddie Tea Party was a blast and we are excited to create city chapters for BiTDAO members to continue to connect IRL!\r\n\r\nTech Educational Scholarships\r\nWe\u2019re proud to have awarded over $35k in educational scholarships to aspiring tech baddies over the years. We plan to allocate a portion of our community treasury to continue to award micro-educational grants and scholarships for women of color to gain in-demand tech skills.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s Next?\r\n\r\nWe have established a strong core team and have begun making governance decisions to lay the groundwork for our DAO membership offering. Because we are onboarding a Web2 native community into Web3, we are being intentional with keeping the \u201cwhy\u201d of BiTDAO first and foremost. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plan on launching the DAO membership to the Baddies in Tech community in January 2023 with amazing membership perks such as an open source resource database and job board, online and IRL events, curated mentorship matching, and opportunities to contribute to earn social capital in the DAO.\r\n\r\nWe are still at the beginning stages of BiTDAO and would love your support during the GR15 round to raise funds to pay our core team, set up our DAO tooling\/infrastructure, and create a treasury which will fund tech educational grants for women of color and other community initiatives. Your support for our mission and vision means the world to us!",

An Open Web3.\r\n\r\nHow\r\nFriends of Pooly, stewarded by PoolTogether DAO contributors, is a project focused on advocacy, fellowship and education.\r\n\r\nAdvocacy: Support for blockchain\/cryptocurrency policies and laws.\u00a0\r\nFellowship: Organizing resources and enabling Community led initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nEducation: Help everyone start using Cryptocurrency and Web3 technologies\r\n\r\nStemming from the need to protect against an incoming onslaught of frivolous lawsuits, Friends of Pooly wants to proactively build a network of forward looking People, Organizations and Companies to defend against the *scum* that decides to come crawling out of the pond.\r\n\r\nPoolTogether Inc, a well-known target, is just one of many companies being attacked right now. This trend will only continue. Now is the time to prepare: organizing networks and share resources.\r\n\r\nFunds raised from the Gitcoin Grant will go towards Community Initiatives:\r\n\r\nOpen Web3 Constitution\r\nPooly Pals Adventures\r\nCryptocurrency Policy + Causes Newsletter\r\nCoalition Building (Members,\u00a0 Lawyers, Politicians, etc\u2026)\r\nEthereum Network State Citizenship (Verifiable Credentials)\r\n\r\nInitiatives are focused on vision alignment, building lore, adding immediate value to the conversation, growing a strong base of supporters and planting the seeds for continued growth and coordination.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to strengthen our core, we expect the Pooly Community to lead more initiatives, and more funds to become available for active contributors. The Friends of Pooly Stewards are committed to creating space for others to take charge and become active leaders and do-ers in the mission to secure an Open Web3.\r\n\r\nWeb3 is a do-acracy. And Pooly is the (r)evolution.\r\n\r\nWhy Friends of Pooly\r\n\r\nFriends of Pooly is a small piece to a big puzzle. We want to defend DeFi and secure an Open Web3 through:\r\n\r\nArt & Culture\r\nEducation & Outreach\u00a0\r\nTechnology & Systems Design\r\n\r\nWe believe Pooly is an embodiment of community and inclusivity. A symbol that represents both, securing an Open Web3 and a coalition of People who embody the best values of an emerging Ethereum Network State. Together we can bring to life a future worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nOur strengths will be using art and culture to power education and outreach efforts. Additionally as we begin to scale up Friends of Pooly we want to democratize access to powerful Web3 technologies i.e make crowdsourcing public goods accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nOur Ask from the Ethereum Community\r\nWe want You to join the mission to secure an Open Web3.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together.\u201d\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies have entered the mainstream zeitgeist. With an intense focus from People, Organizations and Governments all over the world, it\u2019s becoming more and more obvious *things* are happening.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly? We don\u2019t know. That story is unfolding as we speak.\r\n\r\nBut together we can front-run and out-smart the attack.\r\n\r\nJoin us and become a #DeFiDefender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "THE PROBLEM: Along with the financial hurdles of not having enough disposable income or the understanding of how to generate it, marginalized communities suffer from a lack of technical competency, mostly due to an inability to bridge the information gap, and social hurdles such as not being in, having access to or knowing how to infiltrate the \"right\" networks. These limiting factors contribute to the continued marginalization of 100s of millions of people worldwide.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION: To tackle these problems head-on we're aiming to partner with leading research groups in the Web3 space ie. Messari, Dune Analytics, Anchain Ai, Pulsr Ai, Talent DAO and Web3 Women in Science to name a few, in order to conduct analysis of demographic, crypto earnings, reputation and referral data, within our community and the larger Web3 eco-system to:\r\nValidate the need to further onboard marginalized communities, hence, diversifying Web3.\r\nJustify all future requests for funding related to the production and dissemination of educational content and tangible resources\/means of support to marginalized talent in the Web3 space.\r\nMeasure the efficacy and success of our educational initiatives to ensure they are replicable.\r\n\r\nTHE CURRICULUM: We've developed a comprehensive Web3 curriculum to help onboard and upskill those who might otherwise be left behind. With modules like \"the importance of the smart contract\" and \"how-to to fund your web3 project\", our video masterclass will lay out the fundamental understandings necessary to successfully operate in Web3. Beyond the video course work, through s system of bounties, we will employ the savviest Web3 educators in the space, to provide live help, in our proprietary learning platform as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDER:\r\nMy name is Mec Zilla and I\u2019m a Multi-Disciplinary Artist, Design Director & Strategist who has designed and developed campaigns for brands such as Disney, Marvel, UMG, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Vice Media, Afro-Punk, and the like, for over 20 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWEB3 ROLES:\r\nWeb3 Consultant - Converse \/ Jordan \/ Nike\r\nInnovation Consultant - @Deadfellaz\r\nConsultant\/Former Head of Community - @A0K1VERSE\r\nEducation\/ DE&I Consultant - @SuperchiefNFT\r\nMulti-Sig Signer - @ExpansionPunks\r\nNFT Strategy Consultant - @Explorest\r\nGraduated Fellow - @FWBtweets\r\n\r\nTHE REPUTATION:\r\nSince discovering \"crypto art\" in a clubhouse room in December of 2020, I became known for my penchant for hosting the longest Web3-centric AMA rooms. Additionally, I've come to be known as \"the woman who explained NFTS to Gary Vee\" and almost 1 year later \"the marathon host\" after single-handedly running an 18hr Twitter space titled \"The Death of Opensea\" where over 30,000 users discussed building a decentralized and community-owned marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBECOMING AN EDUCATOR:\r\nIt was that experience that solidified my ability to help others understand the space. However, the more I learned about the space the more disheartened I became by the layers of friction I was faced with and my sheer inability to effectively connect with the community that was forming around me. After a 4 month break from all social media, I returned with a fresh perspective and focus on doing what I could to make the space as fair and equitable as possible.\r\n\r\nBECOMING AN ADVOCATE:\r\nWhile navigating the Web3 space as an educator and impact worker I've been invited to converse with various data science organizations including @anchain_ai, @pulsr_ai, and @TalentDAO as well as politicians such as @AndrewYang, @AarikaRhodes, @GregTanaka, @ShannonBrayNC and @DanWhitCongress. And it's thanks to these conversations that I've been able to lend my voice in support of the research that validates my efforts to diversify Web3 as well as to advocate against public policy issues like impending cryptocurrency regulations and the destruction of reproductive rights in much larger public forums.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nTHE MISSION:\r\nAfter a solid year of developing curriculum and building community, it's time to start onboarding the next 10,000 non \"white guys\" to enter the Web3 space and providing the tangible support needed to upskill, place, and accelerate our community members. It is through this work that we can effectively establish ourselves as the #1 resource for diverse talent in the Web3 space and foster a more fair and equitable future. \r\n\r\nFunds received from this grant will help up with our top 5 priorities at the moment:\r\nEstablishing and Incorporating the DAO and sorting tax and trademark logistics \r\nCreate a census as part of our Web3 onboarding and conduct user research with our aforementioned partners\r\nContinued public speaking on education, DE&I and public policy advocacy.\r\nProducing a high-quality video series of our comprehensive Web3 curriculum * \r\nFunding bounties that our community educators can claim to host live spaces in support of our video curriculum\r\n\r\nSo please make your donation today and help up build something epic!\r\n-- mec.\r\n\r\n*video sample courtesy of crwnmag\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "The Olympic Games, Medieval Games, Dog & Horse races, etc... were originally designed around training those societies to prepare against their most pressing existential threats. Physical combat and direct warfare.\r\n\r\nJousting, sword fighting, running, spear throwing, pole vaulting (e.g. spear troops jumping over short walls), rowing, war horses\/dogs, etc all designed around feats of combat. \r\n\u00a0\r\nToday, our society's, indeed humanity's, existential threat is no longer just physical combat. Our threat is a global civilization (supply chains, economic systems, etc) in crises on its way towards collapse. \r\n\r\nA crises in: \r\nmeaning and purpose\r\nrelationship and love\r\nregeneration and thrivability \r\netc\r\n\r\nWe need to train for this transition, honing the skills that will help us succeed in co-creating a diversity of Regenerative Civilizations and Societies and demonstrating skills in unique feats of physical strength won't do it.\r\n\r\nSo, what is the equivalent to today's sports-based Olympics for Regenerative Civilizations?\r\n\r\nWell, for starters these Games are 'infinite games' governed by the people who participate in them. So, the answer to the question of \"how do the Games look\" will constantly evolve and change.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some principles the Games will follow:\r\n\r\nThe ReGen Games exists to help us joyfully train for transition into a diversity of land-based regenerative economic systems. \r\n\r\nLearning the skills: \r\nPermaculture \r\nNatural building\r\nWild harvesting\r\netc\r\nGaining the tools:\r\nOnboarding into Web3\r\nDAOs\r\nReFi, REcon, ReGov,\r\nNew finacial and economic systems to coordinate within and design place-based economies \r\nand providing the spaces from which to co-create our new Regenerative Civilizations from. Which we do in partnership with the \"ReGen Civics Alliance\" which is a growing alliance of land-based regenerative economies.  \r\n\r\nWe're mixing the best parts of:\r\n\r\nSummer Camp with\u00a0\r\nDungeons and Dragons (or The Amazing Race, whatever is most familiar) with\r\nIRL \"We-opoly\u201d(Cooperative Monopoly) with\u00a0\r\nThe ReGenerative Renaissance to co-create...\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nEpic multi-day Games (like the Olympics) to have a ton of fun co-learning about:\r\n\u00a0\r\nReFi\u00a0\r\nDAOs\u00a0\r\nPermaculture, syntropic agroforestry, gardening\u00a0\r\nConflict Evolution\u00a0\r\nEarthship Building\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWild Harvesting and Mushroom Cultivation\u00a0\u00a0\r\nCooking with wild food\u00a0\r\nAdventure skills Camping, fire starting, survival skills\u00a0\r\nSmall team time-constrained coordination\u00a0\r\nDeep dialogue (with the land and each other) \u00a0\r\nand so much more!\r\n\r\nThe games take place at the ReGen & ReFi DAO Campus in North Carolina:\r\n200 acres including a lake and several ponds and you feel like you're in the center of a summer camp while being\r\nAbundance of fresh water year round\r\nHealthy and nourished soil, being a Permaculture\u00a0garden (with syntropic food forests going up each spring)\u00a0\r\nLake for daily kayaking, sailing, etc\r\n20 minutes to the AVL (Asheville NC) airport\r\n5 minutes to town (co-op for organic food and grocery stores, gas, etc of \"Flat Rock\" NC)\r\nWe started our search in the Appalachians\u00a0as this is an incredible Bioregion\r\nAvoiding many of the climate catastrophes expected\u00a0(if we don't reverse course fast enough) in the US\r\n3 seasons and food security (the land already has Gardens and space to easy scale up to meet the food needs of the Campus & Games)\r\nA center of biodiversity (most biodiverse in the US) and beauty and a potential to heal from (e.g. we can start at the source of our water to make our lake drinkable)\r\nNeighbors\u00a0a *massive* city park and golf course (green surroundings)\r\nExisting infrastructure to host events, games, etc for 1000+ people (more if we expand our infrastructure) \r\nstages\r\nkitchens\r\ncafe's\r\n10 cabins (20 with renovations)\r\ndorms\r\ncamping areas\r\namphitheater\r\nboat house \r\netc\r\n\r\n\r\nView of approximately 1\/3 of the lake at the center of the \"~200-350 acre Game Board\"\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the many Cabins and buildings that are part of the ReGen Village Campus\r\n\r\nGrant milestones and funds use\r\n\r\nIf we reach $50,000 in donations then Grant participants will be first to be notified when ticket sales go live by a full 48 hours before other channels are used. \r\n\r\nTeam Tickets = those who want to be part of a 3-7 person team to run through the \"In Real Life Game Board\" earning \"Coins\" and other prizes for completing quests and overall rank.\r\nActive Crowd Tickets = those who want to participate in and watch the games from the sidelines.  \r\n\u00a0\r\nAll funds raised with this grant will go towards \"The ReGen Games\":\r\nregenerating and making more fertile and abundant the land as a vital diverse ecosystem. \r\nAdding more tools and resources for teams who are participating in the games (camping equipment, boats, tools, etc) - similar to the Hunger Games where participants were airdropped equipment. Donations help teams have tools to become more regenerative! and, \r\nreducing the ticket price (as the Games are not for profit) the more funds we raise the cheaper we can make the tickets for teams and attendees (With the goal of making the Games free with a merit\/lottery style selection process to select teams).\u00a0If this grant raises enough to make the games free and we give 48 advanced notice to Gitcoin Grant participants when Game tickets go live; it may turn out that the Games are mostly the Gitcoin community!\r\n\r\nFurthest Stretch goal: Once we've raised a total of $10M we'll buy the resort that is next to the Game Board extending out our lodging capacities and using the revenue from the resort to fund the Games; if this is still a wise move come that time. The resort would be transferred to a Trust governed by a DAO (watch the episodes on Legal for more details here) of all those who've participated in making The ReGen Games a reality.\r\n\r\n### Our tags:\u00a0\r\n#OpenGaming\r\nWe started with the idea \"how can we make co-creating IRL regenerative villages into an epic multiplayer game, so that this transition can be as fun, engaging, and purposeful as possible?\r\nWe're open-sourcing the whole \u201cReGen Games\u201d model so that other ReGen Villages may make Games themselves, as we have an epic time co-creating Solarpunk civilizations, ReGen Villages and more!\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n #DeSci\r\n\ufeffWe're transforming this old summer camp neighborhood into a \"ReGen Campus\" and Incubator for startup cities\/towns using DAOs to co-create and experiment with regenerative economic systems. We're co-creating a learning campus and permanent \"Game Board\" (consisting of both digital tools (e.g. teaching DAOs and DHOs) and IRL \u201cSummercamp-esque campus\u201d - see pictures below) for experimenting with designing alternative civilizations, ReGen Economies, Startup Cities, Networked States, and more all built on top of Web3 and our decentralized global database to coordinate a global Renaissance to ReGenerate Earth. \u00a0 \r\n\r\nWe're open sourcing all our technology (wallets, templates, DAO builders, village templates, coordination hacks, and more) to accelerate the transition to Regenerative Cultures. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n#Web3Social\r\nThis is all to build the IRL campuses and villages where we can bring our web3 friendships into the real world and move out of our Discord\/Zoom meetings and into the community food forests, berry patches, and natural swimming pools. \r\n\r\n#ClimateSolutions\r\nWe're doing all of this to (as effectively as possible) build the foundations we need to coordinate a global \"ReGenerative Renaissance\u201d, that's about coordinating the transition to regenerative cultures. Which we believe is mandatory to address our climate crises.\r\n\r\n### Who we are:\r\n\r\nThe ReGen Games is a part of the ReGen Civics Alliance. \r\n\r\nWe're a global IRL community starting with 13+1 different ReGen projects each season \r\n2 examples: click here to explore the others!\r\n\r\nThe 10,000 ft idea is for our tribes we've been building Web3 to move to physical pieces of land together to regenerate and prototype a diversity of startup regenerative civilizations. To help us in our transition The ReGen Games acts as an incubator for ReGen Villages. \u00a0 \r\n\r\nFor example 1 of the 13 projects from Season 1 of ReGen Civics, after they've completed their \u00a0 \"Crowdpooling\" event, where up to 144 people who have been selected to be part of their \"Minimum Viable Regenerative Economy\" will attend a 3 month ReGen Village incubator to facilitate the 144 people through a process of them co-creating the foundations for their startup society. For example helping projects create their:\u00a0\u00a0\r\neconomic systems\u00a0\r\ngovernance systems\u00a0\r\nconflict evolution protocols\u00a0\u00a0\r\nteaching skills in permaculture, natural building, etc\u00a0\r\netc\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe 3 month incubator ends in the participants demonstrating their skills by putting on a \u00a0 \"ReGen Games\u201d where they take teams of 3-7 players through their \u201cSquares\u201d where they each put on a unique experience, quest, challenge, learning journey, for teams who play the game over a 2-3 day weekend event. Those who are part of the ReGen Village incubator run The ReGen Games for anyone to participate as a team or attend and spectate\/participate in the audience (they\u2019ll be multiple ways the audience interacts with teams).\r\n\u00a0\r\n### Game board elements include:\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Regen Games will be held across a ~350 acre site. Including:\u00a0\r\na large kitchen\/cafe\r\na Community\/Market Garden\r\nan Earthship home construction site\u00a0\r\na machine\/woodshop\u00a0\r\nA natural swimming pool construction site turned wrestling pit\r\nAn archery and ropes course\u00a0\r\nLake, ponds and beaver dams\u00a0\r\nForests, food-forests, gardens, and meadows\r\nNew syntropic agroforestry gardens\u00a0\u00a0\r\nand many more elements\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe first version of the \"ReGen Games Guide\u201d will be released and open-sourced after the Alpha test of the game in October 2022. To give a taste of what teams might expect from the Games as they earn coins and race against the clock\/other teams to:\r\n\r\n1. 'Companion plant' some plants in the food forest (earning various amounts of coins depending on what and how plants were planted, etc)\r\n\u00a0\r\n2. Deep dialogue to address and evolve through an emotional community tension scenario (Square Master gives coins based on the teams solution, etc)\r\n\u00a0\r\n3. Send any amount of tokens to ReGen Civics DAO (Celo, Eth, SEEDS, etc) and participate in the Games governance DAO\/DHO demonstrating knowledge of various economic tools.\r\n\u00a0\r\n4. DAO\/Community governance scenario helping weave 2\u00a0 \"competing\" ideas into a 3rd unifying idea (Square Master gives coins based on the teams solution, etc)\r\n\u00a0\r\n5. Sing a song on the spot. Be given a tune and a theme and come up with a song (scored by points for how well the song pleased the square masters' listening organs).\r\n\u00a0\r\n6. Pound N tires at the EarthShip house building site, or create N bricks for an earthen oven, etc the more your team can create in 15 min the more Coins you earn!\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n7. Transport you and your team to the island in the middle of the lake where you have to solve riddles to find a clue that guides you to your next square on the other side of the lake.\r\n\u00a0\r\n8. Identity and harvest 10 different wild\/edible plants\/fungi (coins based on the rarity (such as special edible mushrooms), diversity, and quantity of the harvest)\r\n\u00a0\r\n9. Dance!\r\n\u00a0\r\n10. Inoculate some logs with mushrooms that become part of the wild Harvest square of future Games11. And a vast universe of possibilities as Square Masters along and in co-creation with the land their square represents, design a unique experience for teams as we co-create a joyful and exciting globally ReGenerative Renaissance.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nAn alpha version of the games is set for the first weekend of October with the first Official ReGen Games going live summer\/fall 2023!\r\n\r\nMore pictures from around the Campus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving you with some glimpses of how AI thinks we'll be spending our time :) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Crypto, A history\r\n\r\nThe most successful products built in crypto today focus on finance and trade.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the early days of bitcoin and ethereum, many people dreamed of building user centric decentralized platform for things like uber, facebook, airbnb etc.\r\n\r\nThe overarching purpose was to increase human flourishing and rek the rent seekers.\r\n\r\nThese projects all failed.\r\n\r\nHonestly we didn\u2019t understand enough about the new paradigm of crypto.\r\n\r\nWe built a yellow-paper on the internet.\r\n\r\nBut now we know so much more.\r\n\r\nDefi, NFT\u2019s and DAO\u2019s have taught us about how to build in this new paradigm by creating a series of composable building blocks.\r\n\r\nPermissionless composition one layer on top of another vs walled gardens one silo after the next.\r\n\r\nWe now have the opportunity to go back to the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroducing The Floo Network\r\n\r\nThe Floo Network is a building block for the future of composable work.\r\n\r\nThe simple technicals:\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s an ERC721.\r\nIt has infinite supply.\r\nIt has a metadata standard.\r\nIt is zero cost.\r\nIt has 3 economic incentives ( aka bounties ).\r\nIt has an allowlist, and a disallow list.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it. ( on purpose )\r\n\r\nEach NFT represents a unit of work.\r\nEvery stakeholder has a built in business model.\r\nIt makes it easy for all people and systems to work together.\r\n\r\nHow we see the future of Floo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Floo Network Roadmap\r\n\r\nDeploy v0 to low cost chains and testnets\r\nSee current contract progress on github.\r\nDeploy v0 subgraphs.\r\nImprove composability of the 3 core incentives.\r\nAllow people to create things like reverse dutch auctions to incentivize expedient work.\r\nAllow for privacy in a public space via Lit Protocol.Much work is not and should not be public. Connecting access control & encryption allows more types of work to be supported.\r\nZero Knowledge Permissions\r\nAllowlist and Disallow-list are implemented via merkle root in v0. This is inflexible. Leverage ZK tech to allow improved and more expressive permissions system that follows new standards coming out of Decentralized ID & Decentralized Reputation spaces.\r\nImprove arbitrary ERC20 Support\r\nAllow for rewards in single or multiple tokens.\r\nSDK, React-Hooks, Improve Subgraphs\r\nBuild tools that make it easy for application developers to interact with the protocol on the frontend.\r\n\r\nOn Not Making Money\r\n\r\nThe protocol will always be free. We are big fans of the hyper-structures thesis.\r\n\r\nOn Making Money\r\n\r\nThe people involved in the ecosystem, and the project itself deeply believe humans making money is a good thing. We will build the companies on top of the protocol that are rewarded primarily via the 3 main incentive models of The Floo Network.\r\n\r\nTechnical Architecture In More Depth\r\n\r\nWe believe that Kleros ( decentralized court ) is an excellent example of the beginning of what we call \u201cHuman in the loop crypto systems\u201d\r\n\r\nWe believe that essentially all higher orders systems can be composed using a combination of the 4 core interfaces of The Floo Network smart contract:\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\nBounty For Apps who Integrate\r\nBounty for Completion of Work\r\nBounty for Recruitment\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\n\r\nUnlike other NFT\u2019s you have seen. Each NFT has its own permissions and bounties. These are not global to the contract as a normal allowlist would be. Also these NFT\u2019s are not tradable like traditional NFT. They fall somewhere between normal and soulbound with transfer and ownership related to current state of work completion.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n\r\nAllow-lists and Disallow-lists\r\nChoosing who can do work, who can see work, who can\u2019t do work, and who cant see work, is fundamental to orchestration.\r\nExample Scenario:\r\nUser takes quiz on 101.xyz to prove they are fluent in Spanish and English. They are awarded an NFT.\r\nUser joins DAO\r\nDAO creates work order for documentation translation and limits it to only those who hold DAO tokens and Proof of Translation Skill.\r\n\r\nBounty for Apps who Integrate\r\n\r\nEach NFT on The Floo Network is created by a user facing application. Each app needs a business model. The app can charge a small fee per NFT created on behalf of the user.\r\nExample Scenario\r\nCompany creates project management tool for DAO\u2019s. They Charge either a flat fee in fiat ( monthly enterprise model ) or a few cents per NFT generated. ( approaches normal SaaS revenue with 1k tasks \/ month )\r\n\r\nBounty for Completion of Work\r\n\r\nEach NFT can includ a bounty for work to be done. This bounty must be deposited at time of NFT creation acting as escrow. This is a way to pay internal contribution directly, or let the open market fulfill your wishes.\r\nExample Scenario 1:\r\nYou allowlist members of your company to be the only ones allowed to do and see work for your organization. You provide zero bounty on the NFT because everyone is paid salary. You leverage The Floo Network because it allows all your employees to use whatever tools they prefer because all work is now portable and interoperable.\r\nExample Scenario 2:\r\nYou are an organization specializing in accounting but you like to deliver your work with slide decks going over the macro details. All of your employee\u2019s are busy accountants so you contract a small number of people you have built a relationship with to make decks for you. You provide a bounty and an allowlist for these people to complete the work as you need it. You have a general agreement on prices before hand which is how you price you're bounties. \r\n\r\nBounty for Recruitment\r\n\r\nLots of modern work is facilitated through platforms. It\u2019s how your food is delivered. It\u2019s how we get from place to place. The recruiter bounty is a way to add an economic incentive for someone to find the person to do the work if you don\u2019t know who it should be in advance. This creates an incentive and business model for people to build service DAO\u2019s, labor marketplaces, and platforms on top of The Floo Network.\r\nExample Scenario:\r\nYou want to throw a big party so you use an app that specializes in party planning. The app knows how to find the cake, hire a decorator, and take care of everything. Under the hood, little to your knowledge, a company that has built a platform for cake makers, makes its money by connecting that app to just the right cake maker for you by acting as the recruiter for this special skill. Cake makers are happy because they don\u2019t need to sign up for every new platform that comes into existence.\r\n\r\nHooks and Interfaces\r\n\r\nThe main for interfaces will be constructed with lifecycle hooks that can be subscribed too before and after for side effects inspired by OpenZeppelin hooks & Lens Protocol Modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Reading And Inspiration\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Day in the Life of a Crypto-Fueled Future - Greg Isenberg\r\nhttps:\/\/latecheckout.substack.com\/p\/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-crypto-fueled?s=r\r\n\r\nPositive Sum Worlds - OtherInter\r\nhttps:\/\/otherinter.net\/research\/positive-sum-worlds\/\r\n\r\nA New Genre of Work - Station Network\r\nhttps:\/\/station.mirror.xyz\/NDGEJB_SUCUVr9ixDwby4D0p_hhwVK3IF0jlixI9B1w\r\n\r\nThe Internet of Jobs is Here - Owocki\r\nhttps:\/\/gov.gitcoin.co\/t\/the-internet-of-jobs-is-here\/9340\r\n\r\nThe TalentDAO Manifesto\r\nhttps:\/\/mirror.xyz\/reneedaos.eth\/0N5qpv-lUFHpcddgTF9N0rKu0DSZ27kJq7MFC_u1RiQ\r\n\r\nHyperstructures - jacob.eth ( ZORA founder )\r\nhttps:\/\/jacob.energy\/hyperstructures.html\r\n\r\nThe Future of Work in web3 - Layer3\r\nhttps:\/\/shift.beehiiv.com\/p\/layer3-future-work-web3\r\n\r\nUnbundling Venture Capital via DAO's - pet3rpan ( MetaCartel )\r\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/1kxnetwork\/unbundling-the-unit-economics-of-venture-capital-via-daos-9fbda3e8113b\r\n\r\nA Novel Framework for Reputation-Based Systems - a16z\r\nhttps:\/\/future.a16z.com\/reputation-based-systems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to get involved?\r\nReach out \u2192 https:\/\/twitter.com\/carllippert",

		"description": "Underground\u00a0DAO\r\nSometimes called the \u2018wood-wide web\u2019, fungal networks connect above ground and below ground life, trees to one another, and break down rocks to extract minerals. We are only beginning to understand how these complex, decentralized networks coordinate collective action\u2014but we do know that they have a profound implications for the climate, enabling 5 billions tons of CO2 to flow from plants to the underground every year. By partnering with SPUN: Society for the Protection of Underground Networks, Underground DAO will collaborate with the world\u2019s leading experts on mycorrhizal fungi pioneer alternative approaches to advancing the science of underground systems. \r\n\r\nWe need to act now\r\nThree-quarters of terrestrial carbon is not stored in trees and plants, but rather underground in soil systems structured by mycorrhizal fungi. These overlooked keystone organisms have been a global blind spot in conservation and climate agendas. Understanding how these networks function\u2014individually and collectively\u2014and the urgent task of linking those functions to larger models of the global climate system so we can take action requires trans-disciplinary teams working in close collaboration.\r\n\r\nEmpowering citizen scientists\r\nWhile the climate crisis is global, the science to address it requires activation at a hyperlocal level. Underground DAO will nurture and connect communities of local researchers and citizen scientists at a global scale, building on existing decentralized research programs. SPUN is already collaborating with remote sensing scientists with the common goal of mapping the global biodiversity of mycorrhizal networks.\r\n\r\nNew models for collaboration\r\nIn addition to scaling best practices, Underground DAO will create the conditions for emergence by enabling new peer-to-peer models for scientific collaboration. In this way, we can cultivate system-level discoveries that emerge only when research specializations interact in service of a broader mission.\r\n\r\nDAO functions\r\nCreate synergies between diverse research specializations to accelerate scientific discovery\r\nEngage geographically and culturally diverse scientific communities\r\nSupport independent research collaborations beyond institutional boundaries\r\nExperiment with alternative incentives for engaging researchers from under-supported regions\r\nEnsure that research gets credited appropriately\r\nEnable talent and capital sourcing\r\nDecrease the time it takes for new datasets to be made available\r\nShare responsibility and ownership of decision-making\r\nEmpower local communities of citizen scientists to contribute to research\r\n\r\nStarting with the science\r\nSPUN is led by renowned evolutionary biologist Dr. Toby Kiers, and includes amongst its board members and advisors leading voices in climate action. We will work with SPUN to define Community Missions that seed self-organizing communities for maximum impact. The result of these collaborations will be made available as digital public goods.\r\n\r\nPotential focus areas for Community Missions\r\nAdaptation: How can we apply protocols and methodologies from diverse disciplines to the science of underground systems?\r\nAggregation: How can we develop common methodologies that ensure data and insights from adjacent disciplines are compatible and can be cross-referenced?\r\nInnovation: What are the missing resources and tools that would accelerate underground science?\r\n\r\nModeling scientific collaboration to support the mission of mitigating climate change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur funding model\r\nThe funds will be divided between platform development and incentivization\r\nIntroduce the SPUN community to the value of decentralized organizational structures and begin the onboarding process\r\nBuild the initial platform infrastructure with a unified interface and user experience that removes much of the friction of web3 onboarding and operations; specifically, integrate DAO tooling such as identity, forum, voting, reputation, contribution, and payment into a workflow.\r\nDesign and implement a coordination protocol based on co-created governance rules and voting procedures to enable scientific communities to self-organize around a scientific roadmap\u2014as a first step to decentralization and automation.\r\nEstablish guidelines and design features for research collaboration, talent sourcing, and network support.\r\n\r\nRethinking DeSci incentive structures\r\nDeSci incentives are often in conflict with existing means of conferring legitimacy within the scientific community. For example, academic scientists may be deeply suspicious of offers of individual incentives, because the introduction of the profit motive may be perceived as compromising their commitment to advancing science for science\u2019s sake. Such incompatible incentive structures create a vicious cycle for DeSci initiates trying to establish legitimacy because they alienate established scientists.\r\n\r\nThe climate crisis provides a rare opportunity to realign priorities by adding environmental impact to the list of values the scientific community holds in common. In this way, academic science is not diminished or precluded, but alternative approaches that emphasize application and synthesis can be introduced alongside existing values.\r\n\r\nBy taking a \u201cboth-and\u201d approach to incentivizing scientific research inside and outside the boundaries of the academic science community, Underground DAO is in a unique position to explore alternative funding and coordination models. These lessons can be abstracted and applied to other academic areas seeking to decentralize in service to a common cause.\r\n\r\nThe team\r\nb-theory is a climate-focused venture studio that accelerates the impact of scientific discovery. We have been working closely with SPUN since its proposal stage to advance its mission of mapping and protecting the underground networks that enable life on earth.",

Specifically, plastics, because they\u2019re so ubiquitous but also because they\u2019re a by-product of one of the most significant negative contributors \u2014 fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nWhat is the #1 problem with the status quo in light of this reality?\r\n\r\nPlastic recycling is broken. 100% of plastic is not recycled; lots of it either gets incinerated, shipped to the Global South, or thrown into landfills.\r\n\r\nWhy should we address this problem?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile the everyday consumer might say \u2014 \"it\u2019s not my problem; it\u2019s up to the recycling industry to change\" \u2014 we believe shifting blame to others isn\u2019t helpful.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlastics are everywhere. Plastic waste affects all human beings regardless of socioeconomic status, demographic differences, and geopolitical allegiances.\r\n\r\nHow would we address this problem?\u00a0\r\n\r\nGiven the status quo, we need to:\r\n\r\nFind a more effective way to repurpose plastics because they will continue to be produced due to their entrenched nature in human society.\r\nFind a more efficient way to distribute this solution to as many people as possible.\r\nFind a more enticing way to attract more and more people to said solution and enable said solution to be as global as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat could we do to address this problem?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have a more effective way to reproduce plastics \u2014 it\u2019s called Precious Plastics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we don\u2019t have a very efficient and enticing way to distribute plastic pellets and attract more people to them. Precious Plastics has a community, a nonprofit umbrella organization behind it, and it is global already; however, it\u2019s not as ubiquitous as the plastic it\u2019s trying to recycle.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to build upon the great work of Precious Plastic by turning plastic into a public good so we can close the loop on the production and consumption of plastics. It\u2019s not going to be easy, it\u2019s a lofty goal, but\u00a0we can start by bringing the Precious Plastic onto the Web3.0 train because it will help them better scale, sustain, and systematize their operations.\r\n\r\nWhat is Circular Economics?\r\n\r\nWe are using up Earth\u2019s finite pool of resources at an unsustainable rate, leading to climate change. Circular Economics (CE) is a new domain in economics which aims to solve this problem with sustainability at its core. Circonomy is our attempt to bring CE into the real world and leverage Web3 to bring about scalable, sustainable, and systemic change.\r\n\r\nCircular economics is an economic model in which the flow of resources in an economy is circular. In this case, plastics should be\u00a0reused\/recycled\/upcycled\u00a0until there is no more possible use case left for them. Reusing, recycling, and upcycling plastic will reduce the level of extraction and dumping of Earth's resources \u2014 giving our planet enough time to replenish its pool of resources. Hence, it is a more sustainable approach.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3RxBIu-cd_Y\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Solution\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll begin by tackling the plastic waste problem because most plastics aren\u2019t 100% recycled, and we\u2019ll partner with Precious Plastics. Precious Plastic is a combination of people, machines, platforms, and knowledge to create an alternative global recycling system. It\u2019s open-source machinery that people can own and recycle their plastic into pellets.\r\n\r\nOur solution will involve setting up small communities called \u2018Circles\u2019 \u2014 (sub-DAOs). These \u201cCircles\u201d will raise funds to invest in the Precious Plastic machinery, thereby gaining common ownership of said machinery. The machinery will then be registered as a node of our decentralized network, similar to Helium's (https:\/\/www.helium.com) behaviour. We (Circonomy) as the DAO forming the umbrella for all these \u201cCircles\u201d will create systems in the form of governance, group communication, and most important of all, a DApp to incentivize better the use of the Precious Plastic machinery within each \u201cCircle\u201d. The DApp will also facilitate a recycle-to-earn program for the individual and collective benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a video summarizing what Circonomy is trying to accomplish:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCirconomy will issue and distribute its token: $CRCL, and will facilitate the transactions in the ecosystem. Circonomy will act as a medium to incentivize 'good recycling behaviour' for its members.\r\n\r\nCirconomy Structure\r\n\r\nSuperDAO = Circonomy\r\nDAOs = Materials, i.e. Plastic DAO for which Precious Plastic will be the primary use-case here\r\nSubDAOs = Circles AKA communities\/neighbourhoods. Ideally, the Circles should be municipalities, but starting out, they\u2019ll be neighbourhoods.\r\nNote: Token = $CRCL\r\n\r\nTerminology\r\n\r\n\u201cCircles\u201d = neighbourhood\/community\r\n\u201cRounds\u201d = crowdfunding campaigns within Circles\r\n\u201cRingleader\u201d = leaders of a Circle (someone in charge of activating the Circle, someone in charge of managing\/maintaining the workspaces\/machinery, and maybe even a storage ringleader) thus forming the\u2026\r\n\u201cCircle Roundtable\u201d = the leadership committee per Circle\r\n\u201cKnights of the Roundtable\u201d = the core contributors of Circonomy at-large\r\n\r\nMVP features:\r\n\r\nCircles will include:\r\nCrowdfunding for setting up Precious Plastic operations\r\n\r\nRecycle-to-Earn cryptoeconomic model \u2014 they\u2019re recycling to earn the $CRCL token; the amount earned will depend on the following factors:\r\nWeight of Plastics\r\nSorted vs. Unsorted Plastics and their respective categories\r\nThe number of devices\/machines as there will be a compounding factor\r\nPrice of plastic in the traditional financial markets\r\nWhere the plastic came from, however harder to track, of course, which means this won\u2019t be a part of the MVP\r\nNote: This will be a bell-curve; however, to prevent gamification\r\nOn-Chain Track & Trace of the recycling activity, thus leading to a decentralized circular economy where every Circle acts as a node.\r\n\r\nThe above MVP flow shows the overall design at a glance. Still, another crucial part of the flow is the \u201cCircle Activation,\u201d one whereby the critical thing here to note is how we envision a future where Circles are populated with more than simply Precious Plastic per sub-DAO.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate a bit further on what we mean, please see the \u201cRegister Device\u201d step (the second one), which is about registering one or more machines\/devices that enable circular economics.\r\n\r\nMVP + features:\r\n\r\n3 primary functions of the Circonomy Dapp;\r\n\r\nRecycle-to-Earn cryptoeconomic model - they\u2019re recycling to earn the $CRCL token.\r\nWin-Win for the individual (Circle Member) and the collective (Circle): Individuals of a circle will earn X amount of $CRCL per recycling activity, but the Circle will earn X amount of $CRCL per sale of the plastic pellets. Individuals earn $CRCL from the Circle itself because the pellets become collectively owned after they\u2019re generated.\r\nMembers may donate to\/support the Circle\r\nRingleaders may create \u201cMissions\u201d - a recycling challenge, i.e. \u201crecycle X amount of Y before the end of the month\u201d\r\nOn-Chain Track & Trace of the recycling activity AKA this will be a decentralized recycling network where every Circle acts as a node\r\n\r\nCircommerce = P2P marketplace\r\n\r\n\u201cEngage Circonomy\u201d = DeFi component - staking, LPing, etc.\r\n\r\nUser Journey\r\n\r\nUser arrives at the DApp\r\n\r\nUser can select a DAO to participate in - \u201cPlastics DAO\u201d\r\n\r\nUser is then required to either activate (not create\/start\/setup) a SubDAO\/Circle or join a Circle\r\n\r\nIf the User \u201cactivates\u201d a Circle, then there is no active plastic recycling operation happening at that local level \u2014 AKA, no existing PP operation happening there.\u00a0\r\nTherefore, we\u2019ll allow the user to crowdfund for the Precious Plastic machinery to be set up in that Circle.\u00a0\r\nIt could cost about $4-to-5,000 USD to purchase the machinery parts, but there are costs for other things like electricity, storage, legal fees (perhaps), etc., for which these are most likely recurring fees.\r\n\r\nIf the User \u201cjoins\u201d a Circle, then there\u2019s already an active PP operation, which means the User can participate in the Recycle-to-Earn program there.\r\n\r\nOnce plastics are recycled in these Circles, activity will be tracked on-chain to ensure provenance and transparent accounting for such activity\r\nPlastic Pellets can be sold to other individuals who may have an Etsy\/Shopify\/Amazon store within the Circle or outside of it.\r\nOr, these pellets may be sold to corporations involved in producing toys, furniture, packaging, home appliances, beauty, etc.\r\n\r\nCircle Members can also participate in DeFi activities with $CRCL\u00a0\r\n\r\nOutside of this, they can participate in our governance. Ideally - we\u2019d like for them to be able to vote on and discuss issues like how to grow the Circle into the whole city eventually.\r\n\r\nThe cryptoeconomics will also include the sale of 'Plastic Credits' \u2014 a plastic offsetting aspect for the Plastic DAO.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEventually, there will be other DAOs for materials such as Metals, Clothing\/Textiles, Food, etc.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Circonomy will be undertaking the following activities:\r\n\r\nSales of Plastic Credits\r\nPrecious Plastic machinery will be registered as nodes of our network\r\nSince the recycled plastic will be recorded on-chain, which is an immutable record, it can be sold to corporations as plastic credits \u2014 used as a method of offsetting carbon emissions\r\nDistribute the gains to Circles in the form of tokens via our recycle-to-earn model\r\n\r\nMarketplace for recycled goods & services\r\nCircle members can sell their goods\/services on the marketplace to make financial gains from their sales\r\nPotential buyers at the marketplace can be: 3D printing companies, furniture companies, members from other Circles, etc\r\nThese goods\/services must be made from or created using the recycled plastics each Circle generates. An example of a service could be someone selling homemade cooking wherein the cutlery\/containers etc, can be made from recycled plastic pellets in the Circle.\r\n\r\nDeFi Activities\r\nBuying\/Selling\r\nSwapping\r\nStaking + Staking Pools\r\nLiquidity Provision (not MVP)\r\nFarming (not MVP)\r\n\r\nIn the future, we will expand our operations to other resources like food, clothing, metals, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarket Strategy\r\n\r\nThree possible routes can either occur in series or in-parallel, or a mix of the two:\r\n\r\nThe first route would be to partner with \/ acquire Precious Plastic or \u201cOne Army Earth\u201d as our first customer, given that they\u2019re also trying to build a DAO for themselves and pilot with existing users and have them be our initial users.\r\n\r\nThe second would be to dogfood this by purchasing the Precious Plastic machinery and registering that as our first node of the Circonomy DAO\r\n\r\nThe third route would be to pivot our MVP to something that can be all-inclusive for the entire Celo ecosystem - a mix of\u00a0Sapien.Network\u00a0+\u00a0https:\/\/www.kolektivo.co\/\u00a0for Celo.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Stage and Current Traction\r\n\r\nEarly-stage bootstrapping right now.\r\nWe started in the KERNEL Fellowship and graduated from them\r\nWe got invited to attend EthBarcelona\r\nWe got accepted into Sapien Network -\u00a0https:\/\/www.sapien.network\/\r\nWe are hoping for CeloCamp to help us go from 0 to 1\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally\r\n\r\nHow will this directly contribute to greenhouse gas reductions or facilitate climate solutions?\r\n\r\nWe aim to increase the amount of circular economic projects worldwide \u2014 starting with Precious Plastic.\r\n\r\nWe want to move the needle from the 8% recycled plastics to a much higher number. A higher level of recycling is achievable by enabling, empowering, and encouraging more neighbourhoods to set up Precious Plastic Operations with our Recycle-2-Earn Cryptoeconomic Model.\r\n\r\nLastly, we aim to expand to recycling other waste materials such as Textiles + Food + Electronics and partnering with companies such as Pela Earth + Volterra. This will allow us to get closer to our goal of reducing greenhouse gasses insofar as ensuring that circular economics is enshrined in our society.\r\n",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7493\/atx-dao-developing-grassroots-dao-legislation",
		"description": "ATX DAO is a grassroots community of Web3 professionals working with the Texas government to draft DAO LLC legislation. Our work ensures such legislation solves real problems without restricting privacy, practicality, or decentralization. Funds raised will directly benefit these efforts by incentivizing wider participation and supporting community education and advocacy, allowing us to more effectively crowdsource our policy recommendations. Watch this 90-second video to learn more about us.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nFor several months, our volunteers have been working with the state\u2019s Work Group on Blockchain Matters to inform on DAO legal frameworks and how they might be improved. On August 19th, we were formally invited to testify at the Capitol about this issue (twitter summary, full video, full written testimony). We have since been asked to provide more comprehensive recommendations and to participate in the drafting of legislation, which requires substantial research, strategy, coordination, and time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs an impact DAO, our primary goal is not monetization, but contribution to public goods. As such, community involvement and creative funding mechanisms are critical for us to operate effectively. Funds raised by this grant will go towards sponsoring these efforts and creating paid opportunities for a more representative group of Austin\u2019s Web3 community to contribute, allowing us to maintain a higher level of engagement and expertise. This will also include education and grass roots advocacy, which will support and inform our work with state government.\r\n\r\nIt is critical that Web3 native DAO contributors with on-the-ground experience participate in this legislative process, and our ability to make this happen represents an incredible opportunity. ATX DAO\u2019s continued work in this important area ensures that any legislation passed in Texas will solve real problems for DAOs while protecting decentralization, privacy, practicality, and the autonomy of members.\r\n\r\nAbout Us\r\nATX DAO is an impact DAO working to unite Austin's crypto communities, enable artists and local businesses to participate in the crypto ecosystem, and educate the government about the benefits of Web3. As a democratic network of developers, artists, and crypto professionals, the DAO provides expertise to local and state government, organizes social events to onboard new web3 users, and helps the best minds in blockchain connect, coordinate, and collaborate in service of public goods.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the year, ATX DAO volunteers have been extremely active in local politics. In January, we hosted a networking event for our members and local legislators to encourage dialogue and build connections between Austin\u2019s Web3 and political communities. In March, multiple members worked together to deliver oral and written testimony to Austin\u2019s city council, providing crucial advice on whether to adopt a \u201ccity coin\u201d, similar to Miami. This 17-page fact finding study demonstrated our ability to distill complicated information such as tokenomics, smart contract scripting languages, and token utility in clear language that was accessible to policy makers and government officials. Through this testimony, we received interest from policy makers to continue and expand the dialogue around web3 policy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFollowing successful development of DAO legal frameworks in Texas, we will continue on to other key issues such as stablecoin regulation, data privacy, and matters of securitization, based on input from the community and policy makers.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to support our grant and learn about our mission.",

		"description": "The Wildlife Movement Institute Mission\r\nOur mission is to create a community of scientists that promotes the designing, development, implementation, and improvement of accessibility to software, hardware, and knowledge resources related to wildlife movement ecology. To realize that vision, we formed The Wildlife Movement Institute, a nonprofit organization to be a hub for this community for local, regional, and international collaborations \u2013 whether you are an expert or someone passionate about wildlife and technology.\r\nProblems Addressed and Why This Matters\r\nThe overarching theme of this community is a synthesis of movement ecology and tracking technology. As movement is essential for everything an animal does in its lifetime, understanding animal movement helps us understand how individuals select habitats, life history traits, and residence patterns. This information can provide information necessary to improve species protection under anthropogenic threats, from climate change to human encroachment. Climate change is more pressing now than ever. Understanding how native and non-native wildlife respond to climate change is critical to their management and conservation.\r\n\r\nStatus Quo and How We Plan to Change That\r\nAlthough radio telemetry has been used to monitor animal movements since the mid-1960s, it was not until the invention of GPS loggers that truly detailed observations of individual movements became possible. However, commercial, proprietary animal tracking systems are expensive and often out of reach for researchers. The number of trackers that can be purchased is too low to gain robust information, thus stifling innovation and vital information to inform species management. The growing trend of using microcontrollers to design tracking units is undoubtedly a revolutionary movement in wildlife movement ecology. Technology does not care what animal it tracks, so long as it does not impede mobility when attached.\r\n\r\nDespite the growing community of tracking biologists creating a higher demand for movement data, there is not a community dedicated to supporting the development of accurate, affordable, open-source trackers and related software and methods. We plan to decentralize the development and manufacturing of animal tracking devices which are integral to the success of our community, leveraging DeSci and other Web 3.0 tools. These tools will support developing a well-governed, decentralized community and document published workflows to replicate and easily build upon prior work. Ned is a DeSci Labs beta tester for DeSci Nodes and is actively engaging with a number of DeSci projects to learn how best to apply and participate in the development of those tools to realize our vision.\r\n\r\nWhat we want to accomplish\r\nOur primary goal is to build a community to support the open-source development and application of animal tracking software, hardware, and methods to economically and ethically track animal movements. Some initial ideas toward reaching that goal include:\r\nLeveraging tools being developed as part of the decentralized science (DeSci) movement to fund, publish, organize, and equitably acknowledge and reward the work and accomplishments of individuals to learn from prior successes and failures more efficiently and effectively,\r\nImplementing existing hardware to the extent practical and designing new hardware when sensible for reliable trackers suitable for a broad range of taxa,\r\nDeveloping software to facilitate customizing movement recording protocols and real-time tracking,\r\nGenerating and distributing funding to support work done by community members, and\r\nPromoting scientific literacy with the public through the community as an outreach platform through visualization of animal movement data and open-source content for biologging development.\r\n\r\nWhy we need help\r\nAlthough The Wildlife Movement Institute was created over a year ago, the progress toward creating a community has been slow. Funds raised through this grant round will be used to finalize the legal requirements required to gain 501c3 status and accomplish a number of tasks largely by offering bounties. Some tasks and anticipated near-term budget expenditures include:\r\nUpgrading our web platform to organize and sustain a community\r\nMigrating and managing the existing GitHub site to a Wildlife Movement Institute GitHub site\r\nCovering costs for the development and production of a new board for tracking small to medium-sized animals\r\nProviding funding for bounties to support website development and create documentation related to building, programming, and deploying animal trackers\r\n\r\nAn Unexpected Journey: How We Got Here\r\nThe journey leading up to this grant proposal started in 2019 when Lam Ngo, a student at Sewanee The University of the South, contacted Ned Horning about different options for tracking Diamondback Terrapins, a mostly aquatic turtle living along coastal areas. Based on Ned\u2019s background with GPS and GNSS technology, and after some tinkering, a small DIY proof of concept tracker that provided tracking information in real-time was created, costing less than a fraction of a proprietary tracker using cutting-edge Long-Range (LoRa) technology and Long-Range Wireless Access Network (LoRaWAN) protocol in tandem with The Internet of Things (IoT). In 2020 Ned created the Terrapin Tracker project, which was a finalist for the Con X Tech Prize managed by Conservation X Labs, and he was able to form a small team to refine the trackers and related software.\r\n\r\nLinked by a common study organism, the diamondback terrapin, Jason Alstad reached out and suggested the creation of an organization to support open-source support for animal tracking. In the spring and summer of 2021, the first prototype trackers were tested in the field in South Carolina and Georgia. Unfortunately, the trackers did not perform as well as expected due to the animal\u2019s behavior, and the process of learning from our mistakes began.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2022, we implemented the next generation of trackers on Blandings Turtles, a semi-aquatic turtle in the Hudson Valley of New York. Through this collaborative work with The Wetland Trust, we met Adam Parlin, a post-doc at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Adam had previously worked with tracking technology on turtles, from electrocardiogram and GPS in free-living individuals. He has been working on applying those techniques to studying squirrel movements based on some of his tracker designs this fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In particular, the research lab will focus on the subproblem of judicial selection.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in this project, you might also like to support Digital Gaia\u2019s Grant (disclaimer, Connor is a team member there, too). Digital Gaia is also working on a credible way to price externalities, starting with climate externalities. We need as many people working on this problem as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat's Option?\r\nOption is a prediction market for governance. Communities that use Option enjoy an environment where it\u2019s profitable for companies to do what\u2019s considered good by the community.\r\n\r\nWhy use Option?\r\nFor consumers:\r\nIt's easy to choose products that are aligned with personal values and beliefs\r\nIt's easy to express personal values in a way that will change companies' behavior\r\n\r\nFor companies and entrepreneurs:\r\nIt's easy to identify which socially responsible action would be beneficial to take\r\nIt's easy to earn revenue for social goods that would otherwise require grants to support\r\n\r\nFor journalists and researchers:\r\nIt's easy to be a high integrity researcher or journalist\r\nIt's easy to find funding for exploring the most important open questions\r\n\r\nFor citizens:\r\nIt's easy to influence policy in an area of interest\r\nIt's easy to ignore politics without bad things happening\r\n\r\nFor communities:\r\nIt's easy to find and form communities of shared values\r\nIt's easy to make collective choices\r\n\r\nHow does Option work?\r\n\r\nPrediction Markets for Policy Setting\r\nOption is a prediction market for governance. Prediction markets have long been considered an effective way for groups to make more accurate collective inferences. The basic way a traditional prediction market works is simple: Anyone can create a market. Like, \u201cIt will rain on Thursday.\u201d Then other people can bet on the outcome. If the market maker says it rained then the people that bet YES get paid, otherwise the people that bet NO get paid.\r\nDue to the value of accurate predictions, many prediction market platforms have sprung up such as Augur, Metaculus, Manifold Markets, among many others. Each of these platforms are excellent at aggregating information and incenting accurate predictions, however, they cannot be used for governance. This is because traditional prediction markets suffer from three shortcomings that prevent their usage as governance tools:\r\nMoral Hazard \u2014 The ability to bet on a particular outcome can create bad incentives. For example,\u00a0In 2021 a man bet $50,000 that there would be a streaker at the Super Bowl, then he put on a leotard and became that streaker.\r\nHidden Information \u2014 Since earning money is dependent on having special knowledge, betting markets incent proprietary information and insider trading\r\nPolicy Impotence \u2014 Even if a market offers a very accurate prediction, there\u2019s nothing to ensure policymakers will listen to it or interpret it correctly.\r\n\r\nOption circumvents these shortcomings by taking away the opportunity for upside from an accurate trade. In Option, it\u2019s free to be right and expensive to be wrong. This counterintuitive choice allows Option to redress the shortcomings of prediction markets for use in governance. For example, this design choice solves certain kinds of Moral Hazard: if the man in the leotard had known the best that could happen is he wouldn\u2019t lose $50,000 he never would have put on the leotard in the first place.\r\n\r\nOption automatically sets its policies based on the predictions of the market. So, when a player bets they don\u2019t expect to be paid for accurate bets, instead, Option players make bets in exchange for shifting the market prediction, and therefore shifting policy. This solves Policy Impotence: predictions in the market directly set policy.\r\n\r\nSince Option doesn\u2019t have to pay out for accurate bets, it can instead use that money to pay for information that lead to resolution of the prediction. Standing \u201cresolution bounties\u201d indicate the most high value places where a player can provide information. This solves Hidden Information: players are paid for information.\r\n\r\nThe details of the mechanisms that power Option are beyond the scope of this grant (if you\u2019re interested you\u2019ll find links at the end). However, it\u2019s worth being familiar with the two general mechanism sets Option uses:\r\nthe Claim Market\r\nthe Semantic Market\r\n\r\nThe Claim Market\u2019s job is to encode beliefs as currency. It gives us:\r\nSincere signaling of belief and values\r\nBribe resistant currency\r\nTargeted funding for research and journalism\r\nNegative money that\u2019s not debt\r\n\r\nThe Semantic Market\u2019s job is to instantiate the game for collective inference and policy setting. It relies heavily on the guarantees of the Claim Market. It gives us:\r\nA surface to interlock claims (enabling conditional predictions)\r\nIncreased influence on more testable predictions\r\nA way to select unbiased judges for each prediction\r\nGame theoretic policy setting\r\n\r\nSetting Policy\r\nLet\u2019s look at a specific example of where regulation was used to try to solve a problem, and how it would have looked different had Option been used. Note that this doesn\u2019t try to tell you why this happens, just describes the behavior.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 New York City proposed a ban on sugary drinks larger than 16 fluid ounces. The argument by the Board of Health was that the limit would improve public health and make it easier for people to reduce their caloric intake. The argument against this ban was that it would be legal overreach, and it violated the personal autonomy of consumers.\r\n\r\nHad New York City citizens been able to use Option, those who wanted to avoid unhealthy drinks would have experienced an increased price for the drinks (akin to a tax) dissuading them from purchasing. In exchange for this tax, Option's prediction that avoiding sugary drinks improves health outcomes would lower the effective healthcare costs of those that opted in to the tax.\r\n\r\nAs a second order effect of this system, soft drink providers like PepsiCo or CocaCola would find aggregate demand drop for the goods predicted to be unhealthy, incenting them to reduce the health implications of their products.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Option maintains individual autonomy while localizing individual responsibility; using markets and preferences instead of legislative bodies.\r\n\r\nExternalities\r\nBut, what about situations where members of a community are harmed by the actions of a company that they don't buy from?\r\n\r\nFor example, what if a mining operation leaches toxins into a nearby river, which harms a biodiverse ecosystem and degrades the health of locals? If those locals don't purchase products made from the mined minerals they cannot exert influence by boycotting the goods, so it would seem they don\u2019t have market-based ability to minimize the pollution.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with economics will recognize that this is a classic example of a negative externality, a \u201cbad\u201d thing that doesn't have a cost associated with it. In this case, the locals and the ecosystem are harmed but the mining operation doesn't pay for that, so they enjoy artificially high profits. The mining company has socialized costs while privatizing gains.\r\n\r\nThe Shortcomings of Regulation\r\nOne option to solve this problem is regulation. For example, the local government could say, \"No more than 0.010 parts per million of arsenic in the water, otherwise we'll fine you 1 million dollars.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, regulation has some well known problems:\r\nRegulation is often slow to respond \u2014 markets outpace and outmaneuver the regulators\r\nRegulation is often imprecise \u2014 it over or under regulates, stifling innovation or permitting great harm\r\nRegulation is often non-dynamic \u2014 it doesn't update with new knowledge\r\nRegulators can become \"captured\" \u2014 the entities they should regulate find ways to influence the decision in their favor\r\n\r\nCoasian Bargaining\r\nEconomic theory offers a clever alternative to regulation called, \"Coasian Bargaining\". The idea is named after Ronald Coase who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for this and related ideas. What would Coase recommend to these people whose river is being polluted?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, his recommendation is very unpalatable to most people. He would tell them to pay the mining operation to pollute less. The mining operation could agree to implement policies to reduce their pollution in exchange for the community paying them to offset the costs of implementing the policies.\r\n\r\nHowever, Coasian Bargaining has proven rarely useful in practice. Even apart from the fact that it feels bad to pay people who pollute, and that it could create a net incentive to pollute more so as to be paid to do less of it, there are more fundamental issues:\r\nHow can the community know how much it actually costs to reduce pollution?\r\nHow will the community verify that the company is implementing the policies effectively?\r\nHow do future generations pay for the benefit of a healthy ecosystem and community?\r\n\r\nFor example, what if the community is willing to pay 2 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%, but:\r\nThe mining company says, \"It costs us 5 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%\" when it really only costs them $2 million.\r\nIt costs 2 million dollars a year to run the water quality tests which confirm the company is complying.\r\nFuture generations, when asked, say that looking back they would have been willing to pay $50 million for a healthy community and ecosystem, not just $2 million.\r\n\r\nNow you can see why Coasian Bargaining is of limited application, it only works where:\r\nThere's no hidden information about costs.\r\nIt's easy and cheap to validate performance.\r\nThe people who are affected are able to pay.\r\n\r\nOption's Coasian Bargaining\r\nHow does Option get around this? Option still uses a form of Coasian Bargaining, but rather than pay the mining company to pollute less, Option allows the local community to put negative valued money into the mining operation\u2019s digital wallet. This forces the mining company to negotiate with the community. In exchange for this ability, the local community makes predictions (which they stake) that the mining operation can dispute. For example, they might say:\r\n\u201cIt only costs 1 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%\u201d\r\n\u201cEvery year, the mining company leaches 500,000 liters of pollution into the river\u201d\r\n\u201cFuture generations, when asked, will be willing to pay $100 million for the healthier community and ecosystem they enjoy thanks to the reduction in pollution\u201d\r\n\r\nBased on the expected future cost predicted by the local community, Option places a certain amount of negative money into the account of the mining operation.\r\nBut what happens if the local community overestimated the size of the future cost? In that case, the mining company can respond with their own predictions, making lower predictions (which they also stake) about the costs of their behavior. For example:\r\n\u201cIt costs us 3 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%\u201d\r\n\u201cEvery year, we only leach 100,000 liters of pollution into the river\u201d\r\n\u201cFuture generations, when asked, will be willing to pay $10 million for the healthier community and ecosystem they enjoy thanks to the reduction in pollution\u201d\r\n\r\nBy taking this action, the mining company reduces the amount of negative money Option places in their account. However, this isn't the end of the story. Now all the money that was bet by the mining company and the local community come into play. That money becomes a bounty which can be paid to researchers and journalists for helping to refine the accuracy of the predictions.\r\n\r\nDisverifier Selection\r\nHow do these journalists and researchers get selected and paid? That's one question this grant will fund.\r\nThe funds earned from this grant will go toward exploring the exact mechanism for how to select informed, unbiased, and sincere researchers and journalists (or \"disverifiers\" in Option's parlance). There are three reasons to think this is a tractable problem:\r\nOption offers a natural way to identify bias \u2014 a measure of ideological \u201cdistance\u201d.\r\nSincerity and accuracy can be well incented by staking mechanisms.\r\nIterative deepening of predictions is a mechanism for incenting precise and resolvable predictions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this work is worth funding even if optimal disverifier selection proves impossible. It may be possible that the worst case performance of Option is still marginally better than some existing governance process. For example, we might imagine that Option fails to live up to the standards of the real-world legal system, but offers efficiencies for use in:\r\nGovernance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\r\nOpen science modeling, e.g. in regenerative agriculture\r\nGovernance of content moderation on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter or their web3 alternatives\r\nReplacing bespoke web3 incentive models with API calls to Option, e.g. Sybil resistance for Gitcoin, or decentralized Yelp where each reviewer makes the claim, \"This review was left by a real customer who was not paid.\"\r\nDAO certification and open source software funding via predictions like, \u201cThis project has no vulnerabilities.\u201d Which simultaneously offers information about the confidence of the developers, while providing bounties for red teaming.\r\n\r\nUse of Funds\r\nThis grant will fund three primary activities performed by the Decision Science and Control (DeSCon) lab of Dr. Philip Brown (or his students, depending on the complexity of universities \u222a crypto ):\r\nProve game theoretic properties about the model (or simplified versions)\r\nImplement the model in-silico and characterize its behaviors\r\n(Stretch Goal) Implement Option as an interactive game\r\n\r\nQuestions worth exploring:\r\nWhat's the Byzantine Fault Tolerance of the inference model?\r\nCan we characterize capacity for information aggregation?\r\nHow do wealth effects (e.g. high income inequality) affect system behavior?\r\nHow quickly can a poorly funded accurate predictor overcome a well funded inaccurate incumbent?\r\nCan Option be framed as a version of a known game for easier analysis, e.g. Beauty Contests?\r\nWhat happens if we allow pricing of positive externalities? Does that introduce risks of collusion?\r\nIs Option capture-proof? How well does Option handle the more general problem of Moral Hazard: companies paying to retain policies that are profitable.\r\nIn what ways might this be exploited to leak private information (e.g. private values and beliefs or transaction history)? Can modifications avoid that?\r\nCan cognitive biases distort the game theoretic prediction, e.g. paying someone in a dubious claim induces sunk cost bias and doubling down.\r\nWhat are the expected psychosocial externalities of using Option? Cf. Twitter and Facebook\u2019s tendency to incite outrage. Look at personas like: intrustors, citizens, disverifiers,\r\nGiven that Option creates funding as a function of disagreement, does this create a meta incentive for disverifiers to stoke disagreement? How does the magnitude of this incentive compare with the existing disagreement incentive of an elected government?\r\n\r\nThis is an incredibly high level overview of Option and its purpose. If you would like to learn more about the details of the mechanisms that underpin Option, here are some good places to start:\r\nClaim Market Prototype (link) This is a toy implementation of the Claim Market, the token layer of Option.\r\nSemantic Market Deck (link) This deck overviews the mechanisms of the Semantic Market, the inference layer of Option.\r\n\r\nAdoption Plausibility\r\nFinally, it's worth addressing the most common objection to Option: if Option makes it more expensive to purchase goods and less profitable to sell goods, and it opens companies up to an additional form of liability, how will it ever get adopted?\r\n\r\nFor companies, Option fills the same niche as LEED certifications, Better Business Bureau grades, Corporate Social Responsibility teams, and Fair Trade and Organic product labels. For companies that are sincere in their claims, Option creates a measurable surface upon which to demonstrate that sincerity. A company that practices ethical manufacturing will accept Option's currency and stake predictions on Option in order to differentiate themselves from competitors that only purport to practice ethical manufacturing.\r\n\r\nSome consumers will reject transacting in non-Option currencies just as some people today refuse to purchase non-Fair Trade goods. Other consumers will transact in Option simply because it can save them money on certain products, e.g. the health insurance savings thanks to the voluntary tax on soda.\r\n\r\nFinally, for regulators and lawmakers Option provides new mechanics for making regulations that are responsive to the research community. In the long run, communities, nations, and planets with better foresight and a better ability to avoid negative externalities will outlast those that don't.",

Water from a stream or spring becomes structured as it spirals along its natural path. We all know the difference between drinking vibrantly alive water compared to water that has been sitting in a pipe and plants know the difference too. A finely tuned water structuring device emulates the natural flow of water to optimize its life giving effect on humans and plants alike.\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\r\nSeveral water structuring devices are currently available and have demonstrated promising results in agriculture, but the technology hasn\u2019t crossed over yet as a major regenerative agriculture solution.\r\nAvailable water structuring devices used in agriculture today are closed source, relatively expensive, not well known, not well distributed and do not have high legitimacy. (Vitalik outlines legitimacy well here: https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2021\/03\/23\/legitimacy.html)\r\n\r\nThe Solution\r\n\r\nWe intend to design an effective, low-cost and open-source water structuring device and create legitimacy for that device through thoughtfully conducted decentralized science experiments.\r\nWe hope to collaborate with ImpactDAOs and MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) efforts to offer regenerative farmers a low-risk, low-maintenance and potentially high reward solution to their farms.\r\nWe believe water structuring is a key agricultural solution with the potential to significantly accelerate natural carbon sequestration while reducing water requirements and significantly bolstering yields for regenerative farmers.\r\nWe believe that through building open-source tools and collaborating with ImpactDAOs we can positively impact farms of all sizes around the globe.\r\n\r\nDeliverables\r\n\r\nPhase 1) Prototype an open-source, low-cost water structuring device\r\nPhase 2) Design a decentralized scientific study in collaboration with with ImpactDAOs, MRV initiatives and regenerative farmers.\r\nPhase 3) Conduct the study. Measure key changes to crop and soil health with water structuring device.\r\nPhase 4) Collect, analyze the data \u2014 publish our study and water structuring device design.\r\nPhase 5) Iterate with feedback and results from initial study\r\n\r\nWhat the funds will be used for\r\nResearch existing water structuring devices\r\nDesign low-cost prototype water structuring device\r\n3D print prototype and run preliminary experiments\r\n3D print and ship water structuring devices to participating farms for larger decentralized study\r\n\r\nTeam\r\nDaniel Friedman, Lena Cole\r\n\r\nCollaborators\r\nTrue North (https:\/\/truenorth.land)\r\nWe invite you as our funders to become our collaborators!\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Let ordinary people have more opportunities to participate in Move's blockchain ecosystem.\r\n  At present, the new blockchains of Move language represented by Aptos and Sui are developing rapidly, and the financing amount has reached a new high under the overall market downturn, and the consensus that the new blockchains based on Move language will become the next bull market leader is getting stronger and stronger. The new blockchain represented by Aptos also opens a new model of capital public chain, and the opportunity for ordinary people to participate is getting less and less.. MoveDAO provides a new model of participation in the Move ecosystem, and through the power of the community, MoveDAO will provide continuous support to the Move ecosystem through education, talent training, project promotion and project incubation, and gain knowledge, opportunities and economic returns from them, most of which will be distributed to the members of the DAOs.\r\n  Currently, MoveDAOs community has more than 120 members, including senior developers from Amazon, Ali, Tencent and other major companies, as well as resident representatives of capitalists. The project currently has an education group, an ecosystem research tracking group, and a promotion group operating independently. A lot of document translation work has been done, while more high-quality projects are on the way to launch.\r\n\r\nFundraising plan\uff1a\r\n\r\nIf the total amount of funds raised, 1~100,000U\r\nwill be raised for the promotion and growth of the organization, mainly for community promotion activities and the output of Move education courses. The community is currently in a better upswing, and with the funding boost, we will be able to hold more quality Space events and rapidly expand the community's influence.\r\nIn addition to educational and research expenses for the promotion and Move language, the rest of the funds will be used to reward outstanding proposals and to make early investments in Move eco-projects. The proceeds from the investment will be returned to the community and investors.\r\n\r\nIf the total amount of funds raised, 100,000~1,000,000U\r\nIn addition to the necessary team expenses, the funds will be mainly used for Move language ecosystem, professional talent training output, and providing ecosystem support services, cultivating 1~5 direct ecosystem projects, and establishing sufficient ecosystem influence.\r\n\r\nIf the total amount of fundraising is higher than 1 million U\r\nWe will set up an incubation fund jointly with project parties and capitalists, rely on MoveDAO's resource advantage in Move ecosystem and information advantage, and invest in excellent projects in Move ecosystem. At the same time, we will develop professional services such as technical services and talent training, and obtain returns from these aspects.\r\n\r\nWe promise that the use of all donated funds will be regularly publicized and supervised by donors.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, the complexity of launching and running an investing DAO, particularly compliantly, can be overwhelming even to experienced crypto users.\r\n\r\nMinidomn makes it easy to channel money into a multi-sig and invest with your network. Since everything is on-chain, distributions happen automatically via smart contracts. Meanwhile, Minidomn also limits the personal liability of investment DAO members by giving DAOs the option to compliantly connect to LLCs and other real physical capabilities.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still early and very few people have access to the product. The product is still in private alpha but the team is busy building smart contracts to experiment and automate much of the user experience.",

Otomee also features a built-in marketplace where communities decide the rules, with fees as low as 0%.\r\n\r\nWhy is your contribution important?\r\n\r\nIn recent months, the web3 ecosystem has suffered from censorship attacks against communities and individuals, delisting their assets from the leading platforms in the industry. It is ironic that a movement such as web3 whose ethos is openness, transparency and decentralization, doesn't have truly permissionless tools.

With a built-in, open marketplace, your community can exchange NFTs and decide whether they want to pay royalties or transact completely free.\r\nOtomee introduces a new user-centric model where individuals will be able to curate NFT listings from different communities and present them on their themed profile page, under the Curation tab. All sales made through the user\u2019s Curation page will give him a % of the sale defined by him, creating new markets and opportunities for individuals to leverage the metaverse economy.\r\n\r\nA Highly customizable Presentation card:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtomee will give communities and individuals the tools they need to express themselves through their collections, offering artists, communities and collectors full control over the look and feel of their profiles and pages so they can be used as the ultimate way of representing their whole identity in one place.\r\nThese features will remain decentralized and on-chain in the form of NFTs with gas efficiency and flexibility as top priorities. Creators will also be able to share their custom themes with the world. It will be up to them to decide how they will be distributed: be it in the form of an airdrop to their communities, a free mint or if they want to charge for them. This opens a completely new sea of possibilities for communities and creators to connect.\r\n\r\nOnboarding brands and communities to the Metaverse:\r\n\r\nIt is important to create easy ways for traditional brands and communities to dip their toes into the metaverse. Otomee helps them with one-click SC deployments from a preset of the most popular NFT standards and drop strategies, with automatic integration to the Otomee ecosystem.\r\n\r\nENS at its core.\r\n\r\nOtomee implements Sign In with Ethereum and ENS as its authentication system, implementing resolution for ENS names and avatars, but more importantly, giving communities a subdomain of Otomee.eth for their community page, helping them avoid phishing scams.

Besides, settings like community themes and royalty settings (If set) will be saved in text records of the community\u2019s subdomain.\r\n\r\nOtomee uses ENS to power the platform and you can use Otomee to power your ENS experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENS users will have an intuitive interface to easily customize their ENS text records and set their NFTs as ENS avatars with one click, or using non-NFT images dragging and dropping to upload them directly to IPFS. If set, these text records like description, location and social media handles will be displayed in their Otomee profile.\r\nTo leverage Otomee\u2019s built-in, censorship-resistant marketplace, the ENS community will be able to buy and sell ENS names with ENS-specific filters and 0% fees.\r\n\r\nThe architecture: \ud83e\udd13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtomee has been designed with decentralization as a top priority. It features a serverless architecture using technologies like the EVM, IPFS to store the Web App itself, orders, setting and themes; Orbitdb to manage the data, The Graph to index blockchain information of NFTs and SCs, and ENS to logically structure the platform. None of these services has a single point of failure and every line of code of the platform is open source, thus creating a self-sustainable marketplace that everyone can use, no one can control, anyone can verify and no one can stop.\r\n\r\nThe Roadmap:\r\nMarketplace Smart contracts\r\nBuilt-in marketplace\r\nDefault Community page and User profiles\r\nENS regular and reverse lookups integration\r\nCore subgraphs\r\nMVP (Compile source code and run on the Rinkeby Network)\r\nTemplate engine integration (Themes)\r\nENS subdomain system\r\nENS profile editing page\r\nOne-click SC compiler and deployer\r\n\r\nHow you can help:\r\n\r\nIf you believe Otomee can add value to you or your community and would like to support the project, here are two ways you can do it:\r\nThe code is open source and PRs are welcome!\r\nIf you want to contribute through the Grant round, even a $1 contribution will help us massively pay for SC deployments in mainnet and subgraph queries and auditing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMade with \u2764 for the world.",

		"description": "Help us cultivate a Mycelium Knowledge Network for Self Organizing Collective Action.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRegeneration is an emerging paradigm in web3, motivated by the existential risks of our degenerative economic systems based on extraction, exploitation, and pollution. Global warming, biodiversity loss, and poverty are examples of issues that ReFi and Impact DAOs are addressing. A global movement is rising for the use of web3 for good, but the nascency and decentralized nature of the space prevents innovators from easily knowing and navigating the ecosystem. To cause our individual actions to aggregate to planetary scale regeneration requires intelligent coordination as a network within and across distributed organizations (DAOs). \r\n\r\nTo coordinate at a global level, we need a decentralized knowledge network which can enable us to\u00a0\r\nMap the ecosystem\r\nWho and what exists? How are they related?\u00a0 People, groups, media, standards, science, events, jobs, etc.\r\nSpread knowledge\r\nSearch and recommendation to provide access to relevant information\r\nBuild relationships\r\nBetween people, groups, and other resources\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe\u2019re doing these things already\u2014in discord, telegram, and a growing group of web3 specific organization tools\u2014but lack a holistic map and compass to help us comprehend and navigate the ecosystem we are co-creating.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nPeople may want to learn how to contribute to system change but don't know how. Investors have committed trillions to climate finance but don't see how to distribute it.\u00a0 By mapping the ecosystem, we create paths for progress.\u00a0 By allowing for discourse to be embedded in the map, we can build roadmaps for DeSci, investment, engineering, and overarching stories that underlie regenerative cultures. Shared stories can catalyze a critical mass of people, and mobilize the funds, legitimacy, and other resources necessary to make the systems-level changes we so urgently need.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo, what are we doing? We are solving an important piece of the coordination stack. We are building a semantic social network- a platform that is designed for you to tell your story and share what people, projects, and other resources you\u2019re connected with. These local perspectives can be linked together to show a big picture view: who and what is in the ecosystem of #ReFi and how is it all connected together? What are people working on?\u00a0 What is needed? What is being offered? This content can also be used specifically for investors, to provide a clear picture of the value proposition of projects in the space.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe backbone of this platform is a database of knowledge integrated into a graph structure. Knowledge graphs put data in context via linking resources to each other and to semantic metadata to provide a framework for data integration, unification, analytics and sharing. They are already used by the big social networks, search engines, personal AI assistants, markets, and other siloed enterprises that deal with networks.\u00a0 By integrating data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom, we can create an open knowledge graph for the global network of regerates.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nKnowledge graphs are easy to conceptualize, they are made by connecting nodes representing things (objects, events, ideas, people, projects, etc) with directed edges representing relationships.\u00a0 This symbolic structure allows for the meaning of the data to be both machine and human readable.  The data can be browsed visually like a map or with a search engine like Google.  Knowledge graphs can be combined with machine learning to improve AI, creating the possibility for humans and machines to work together to cultivate and apply intelligence for regeneration.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHere is a visualization of a knowledge graph to give you a better idea:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nA secret sauce to Knowledge Graphs is ontology, the design of schemas for the types of resources and relationships in a domain.\u00a0 This provides a standard structure for data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR). We hope to work with stakeholders across the ecosystem to steward ontologies for various sub-domains, such as DAOs, jobs, and MRV.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe\u2019re building this open source. We'll leverage a current prototype that we\u2019ve built for a team at NASA. We\u2019ll build an app with screens for DAOs, founders, job seekers, investors, storytellers, to share and publish information. We'll collaborate with other groups like ReFiDAO on projects such as self sovereign profiles and an impact explorer. We\u2019ll build community on Twitter to promote this platform with the many voices of #ReFi as the world\u2019s innovation force for the future. \r\n\r\nWe know that trees can exchange resources through underground fungal networks in a \u201cwood wide web\u201d. Blockchain networks can be seen to allow for value to be exchanged in a similar way for humans.\u00a0 However, trees also need to communicate through these networks to know how to share resources and coordinate to avoid disasters and flourish as an ecosystem.\u00a0 We are building a similar\u00a0intelligence system to complement blockchains. In short, we are building a self organizing collective intelligence platform for planetary scale regeneration.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat have we done so far?\r\nWe have gathered core contributors including\r\nEllie Young\r\nJenn Baez\r\nDarren Zal\r\nKaterina Carbonell\r\nWe have been conducting interviews with ReFi projects to inform our first ontology.\u00a0 If you want to participate in this process, please sign up for an interview or fill out our survey here.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow will we use funds from this grant?\r\nWe will design and build the knowledge graph as a commons, making it as free, open, and decentralized as possible.\r\nWe are also building a public website for interacting with the graph. Here is a simply mockup of how it could look:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nThank you for your support and please reach out if you want to chat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Imagine a decentralized society having crypto and web3 policy supporting freedom and innovation, and arranging a DeFi beach and other crypto venues. This can be achieved by the process of independence with local self-determination (recognized by the regime of Venezuela), which could then provide for the world an example of a societal transition to crypto and its benefits.\r\n\r\nExisting sandboxes, economic zones or the like are much subject to legacy rules or the whims of future political leaders (see, e.g., the recent Honduras zone revocation, the Nevada State Legislature\u2019s unwillingness to provide the regulatory framework requested by Blockchains LLC). Ethereum innovators care about maintaining significant rights (free trade, self-custody, renounceable contracts, censorship resistance, anonymity by entities and of beneficial owners, not sanctioning or blocking innocent groups such as Venezuelans or Iranians, etc.), which most Venezuelans already agree with or would recognize in their public policy.\r\n\r\nBut despite all the \"crypto revolution\" hype, Venezuelans remain bound to a regime that imposes oppression within deteriorated infrastructure. Since 2019, a Law of the Integral System of Cryptoassets heavily restricts operations with crypto, requiring registration with or permission from a Superintendency. Since 2022, transactions that are not in an official currency, including cryptocurrencies other than the Petro, are further taxable. In July 2022, special economic zones were created, but are likewise centrally planned and do not provide confidence of legal security.\r\n\r\nThe Independence Workstream of Paraguana DAO, thanks to a handful of local activists in the Peninsula of Paraguana in Venezuela (one of the economic zones), has started to collect signatures to declare the Peninsula as an independent crypto zone or country, initially governed by direct democracy of one vote per citizen with decentralized governance tech.\r\n\r\nWith this grant, the Workstream seeks to conduct crypto advocacy and advance \"good crypto policy and defense of the open web\" in the following manners:\r\n\r\n1.Conducting advocacy, awareness, and consultations for this cause at Devcon Bogota (because international support is important). We have proposed to Devcon a community hub for \u201cDecentralized Societies, Network States or Crypto Jurisdictions\u201d in which an activity could be \u201cinternational assistance sessions\u201d but it was not accepted; with Gitcoin funding, we could do this individually, for Venezuela. We could also outline how the crypto community would see a crypto jurisdiction with good policy out of an independence, fork, or negotiation for sovereignty from an existing state. No expenses would be made for travel or accommodations.\r\n\r\n2.Producing a report of efforts undertaken and learnings to date, including interviews with activists and an approximation of community reactions, for the benefit of other activists or supporters who might want to advance similar efforts.\r\n\r\n3.Printing propaganda in Spanish on why good crypto policy and defense of the open web is necessary and should be achieved by way of the referendum (see this folder of materials), tracking each material\u2019s impact in terms of signatures obtained. This does not include production or distribution work, which is better to be funded or volunteered locally.\r\n\r\n4.Experimenting with paid ads in local outlets (that are not owned by sanctioned persons), with up to 5% of the grant funding, tracking each campaign\u2019s impact in terms of signatures obtained.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of funds and impact will be tracked as it is deemed viable, considering security and privacy for funds used in Venezuela, and will be reported within three months.",

		"description": "We are building a knowledge and resource sharing network to support (and learn from) those who are building non-extractive models of community through recovering the teachings of our lands, ancestors, and cultures.\r\n\r\nSo far in our work outside of the blockchain space, we\u2019ve helped thousands of people get started with their first homes, retain access to their homes and\/or lands, and have built several circles through ceremony, creative, healing residencies, and a tiny home community. \r\n\r\nWe are now coming together to work across generations and geographies to create a collective resource network \u2013 3Seeds DAO - based on the experiences of diverse community builders, so that anyone can envision their own path to home and community, connect with others, and eventually build themselves with support from the DAO.\r\n\r\nWith this funding we will be able to advance our two current core initiatives by launching the online community space and starting a pilot project on the first physical community site called Tierrita Grande in South Texas.\r\n\r\nOur Current Core Initiatives:\r\n\r\nAn online community space. We are creating an open-source virtual space for learning and connection. We will first start by hosting a monthly speaker series and continue building out open-source educational modules from our past build experiences, from our current build experience with Tierrita Grande, and from others in our network who are building.\r\n\r\nResearch, Development & Documentation of low-cost, simple models for systems using Tierrita Grande (or other DAO partners) to test and implement. This will all feed into our open-source knowledge sharing platform we are building (see long-term plans below). We are currently testing systems for water and options for low-cost small dwellings. We have relationships with researchers and alternative builders to start these research pilots and documentation.\r\n\r\nWithin five years we hope to:\r\n\r\nHave a comprehensive, holistic community development ecosystem on-chain to support those who are building models of community in right relationship with the land and her original stewards. This resource network will include human resources (builders, technicians, educators, healers, artists), educational resources, physical resources (products, materials), legal resources, and financial resources (shared purchasing models, sponsorships, and funding pools).\r\n\r\nWe are excited to work within the blockchain space not just to create the resource network, but also to be able to leverage other models being created within the space. We are especially interested in partnering with those who are creating tokenomics models for land stewardship and with game designers to be able to co-create designs in the metaverse to implement on the physical earth.\r\n\r\nWhy this model:\r\n\r\nLand, home and community are increasingly out of reach for many people. Unfortunately there are very few resources and little funding for those wanting to build outside of the current model that treats land as a commodity and expects a high financial return on investment from development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMany people saw the benefit of community during the pandemic, whether that was sharing with neighbors or physically building a community. As community builders ourselves, we had people reach out to us asking for advice on how to create communities on their lands.\u00a0Rather than a top-down model, we saw the need for an open, knowledge-sharing network where all of us could learn from one another, create educational resources from our unique experiences, leverage our collective power for joint purchasing, and share sponsorships and funding streams.\r\n\r\nHow our model differs from existing ones in Web3:\r\n\r\nWe investigated other community and land development models within the blockchain space to see if we might put our network under an existing initiative already well established; however, ours differed significantly from what we saw.\r\n\r\nTwo DAOs we researched and participated in calls with were Cohere and CityDAO. While we are intrigued by CityDAO\u2019s novel approach to buying land on-chain together and governing the land within their DAO, our communities are not looking to put their lands into the hands of strangers, especially a group where we don\u2019t see many people who look like us. We will, however, continue to follow their progress and learn from their model for co-ownership of land on-chain for our future community projects.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAnother DAO \u2013 Cohere - is building communities and seemed like it could be similar work to ours, yet we found some substantial differences. Cohere designed a community development model first (geared towards one demographic \u2013 remote workers\/digital nomads), got traditional Wall Street investors on board, and are now looking for lands on which to implement their model. We, on the other hand, have a network of people with lands who are interested in listening to the land first and designing flexible models that work with what the land needs and creating accessible spaces for all ages and all types of contributors (not just those who can work remotely).\u00a0\r\n\r\nLet's Build Together!\r\n\r\nThe pandemic led many people to want to create new models for home and community, yet they may lack the resources and\/or knowledge to do so. 3Seeds DAO will create an equitable knowledge and resource sharing network network based on the experiences of diverse communities, so that anyone can envision their own path to home and community, connect with others, and eventually build or join others in building.\r\n\r\nTeam and Contributors:\r\n\r\nCore Team:\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnel Flores - Entrepreneur, Realtor, Artist, Author & Healer\r\nAnel I.

		"description": "DECODE, a Zero Waste Fashion Technology company is fighting greenwashing and setting an unprecedented standard in transparent manufacturing, through on-chain smart certifications and automatic metadata capture, all while removing waste from the equation.\r\n\r\nDECODE Zero Waste Technology for apparel removes all waste from manufacturing, eliminating the fashion industry's average of 20% waste- which amounts to 60 billion meters of wasted fabric every year.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile Zero Waste Manufacturing is a very scalable process, it requires exact methods to produce correctly. This is very similar in concept to Champagne vs. Prosecco, or Gucci vs. knockoff. In our proposal, we will address how smart certifications on blockchain will help us scale responsibly through our Zero Waste Certification while fighting greenwashing efforts in the physical world (greenwashing: corporate attempts to capitalize on the demand for 'sustainable' products, while contributing a bare minimum and conflating numbers).\r\n\r\nIn short, we will do so by auto-capturing physical manufacturing data to establish provenance, leveraging available blockchain protocols & ongoing partnerships with key web3 companies and CNC (computer controlled) machine tech developers.\r\n\r\nWe will accomplish this using:\u00a0\r\n\r\nZero Waste Technology x Certification x Manufacturing metadata x Blockchain protocols\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\nDevelop and implement an open-source smart certification process for physically manufactured goods on-chain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout this presentation, the following statements will be proven \u201ctrue.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nZero Waste = the future of design\r\nScaling Zero Waste = removing waste\r\nAutomatic metadata capture = verifiable provenance\r\nThe Zero Waste process needs protection through certification\r\nCertifications, manufacturing metadata, and blockchain are perfect use cases for each other\r\nAutomatic manufacturing metadata is the missing link for end-to-end smart certifications\r\nAll of the above are scalable across all industries, not just fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n1) DECODE Zero Waste Technology\r\n2) Zero Waste Smart Certification\r\n3) Manufacturing metadata collection\r\n4) Blockchain integration\r\n5) Partners\/team\r\n6) Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\t1.) DECODE Zero Waste Technology:\u00a0\r\n\r\nDECODE can be defined as a designer-owned Zero Waste Design & Manufacturing innovation hub based in Brooklyn, NY. Using the tools we have developed for more than a decade, we are set to prove that Zero Waste Design & Manufacturing is a scalable system.\r\n\r\nTo put it in context, the fashion industry is the second most wasteful worldwide, wasting an average of 20% of fabric that is never used in a garment. Our Zero Waste Technology uses highly complex pattern engineering to accomplish 100% pattern efficiency. This leaves no waste in production; we call this True Zero Waste since we eliminate waste before it even happens.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBelow we will demonstrate how:\u00a0\r\n\r\nRemoving waste while reducing material needed = saving businesses money and saving the planet valuable resources.\r\n\r\nFor our example, we will use a Zero Waste pattern we developed in collaboration with varsity jacket brand, Settlemiers. This resulted in a cutting-edge limited edition jacket in collaboration with web3 brand Metafactory, using Kong\u2019s innovative v1 halo chips. (p.9-10 in linked document)\r\n\r\nSettlemier\u2019s original pattern wastes 24% of fabric. Using our Zero Waste Technology, we successfully removed waste with a pattern suited to using 100% of fabric.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe best part? On top of removing all waste from this pattern, we were able to manufacture an additional 10 jackets from the same amount of fabric. This incredible efficiency, if we apply this to all garments made worldwide, will have an astoundingly positive impact on the climate, with the added benefit of saving businesses money.\r\n\r\nIn short, Zero Waste Technology = the future of design\r\n\r\nScaling Zero Waste = removing waste\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t2.) Zero Waste Certification:\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhere the Zero Waste process needs the most safeguarding is at the intersection of design & manufacturing. Design is only a proof of concept if not implemented- and if implemented incorrectly, the process itself is diluted. In the case of Zero Waste, if a Zero Waste Pattern is adjusted or implemented incorrectly, it should not be called Zero Waste. Because of the implied guarantee in the name, we need an open certification process.\r\n\r\nHere (p. 12 in our document) is a perfect case of a pattern used incorrectly. Just one part of how it can be used incorrectly, nesting software has not yet been developed to handle truly Zero Waste patterns. Using CLO3D (industry standard for 3D apparel), we find that their nesting software comically misinterprets our already perfectly nested Zero Waste Pattern. \r\n\r\nGiven that nesting software is universally used in computerized manufacturing, without first knowing that our patterns are already perfectly nested, it\u2019s more than possible that a facility can cut an entire batch of clothing the wrong way.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLuckily, there\u2019s a clear path forward.\r\n\r\nIncluding members of ZWDC [Zero WAste Design Collective], of which Danielle is a founding member, we have a foundation already in place for an international certification for all Zero Waste Apparel applications. In being a separate entity from DECODE, this certification will independently employ experts worldwide while connecting designers and manufacturers with those seeking to participate, while certifying & auditing patterns and products as Zero Waste.\r\n\r\nIn order for this certification to be as user-friendly as possible, and without requiring persistent oversight, automatic smart certifications will need to be employed through smart contracts and blockchain protocols. Luckily, the answer to both comes down to computerized manufacturing equipment.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNot only does using a CNC machine make it nearly impossible to improperly cut a Zero Waste pattern, but it also provides metadata that, when combined in real-time with blockchain, allows for immediately verified certification signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t3.) Smart certifications through manufacturing metadata:\r\n\r\nAlright, on to the meat of the subject: automatic manufacturing metadata capture.\r\n\r\nThe best analogy to use here is the digital camera.\u00a0 When a photo is taken, a snapshot of all pertinent information is automatically captured. Location, time, and pertinent data are all stored with the image.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSimply put, we need this process for manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe problem with greenwashing: claims are hard to verify and often conflated\r\nThe problem with blockchain metadata: a lot of current metadata is human volunteered, leaving room for misrepresented\/incomplete data (greenwashing)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a smart certification needs:\u00a0\r\n\t1) pertinent metadata is automatically captured & publicly made available on-chain\r\n\t2) this metadata proves \u201cwho, what, when, where\u201d and is directly linked to a specific product.\r\n\r\nIn more specific terms, for a certification to be automatically granted, we need to prove that \u201cthis certified operator is cutting this certified pattern on certified equipment, at this location\/date\/time.\u201d if all marks are met, a certification is issued via blockchain signature, through a dedicated eth address.\r\n\r\nLuckily, with CNC-operated machinery, metadata is constantly being generated- it only needs a method of translation.\u00a0 Combining open-source firmware software such as g-code, and developing a system that outputs readable metadata for blockchain, this project lays the groundwork for all possible CNC-operated applications.\r\n\r\nWe have paired with Simon Johnson and Shruti Grover from Pattern Project UK, who have built their own CNC fabric cutting table and have developed their own software from scratch for their micro-factory in London, UK. As partners in the development of Zero Waste cutting applications, we will be developing this machine for this intended use, opening the door for unprecedented transparent manufacturing standards.\r\n\r\n\t4.) Blockchain protocols\/process:\r\n\r\nOther than simply verifying this metadata, how this metadata is stored and linked to any final product is crucial to maintaining integrity. We plan to do so through currently available protocols\/software:\r\n\r\nFOAM- a tamper-proof location verification protocol\r\nARWEAVE- decentralized storage (DSN) for permanent, sustainable data storage\r\nIPFS- interplanetary file system for file sharing\r\nSelf-sovereign halo KONG chips- physical NFT NFC chips for permanently linking metadata to physical product\r\nERS- Ethereum reality service: an on-chain visual launcher for use with kong\u2019s NFC chips\r\nMFO- \u00a0Metafactory\u2019s operating system, combining ARWEAVE and IPFS on-chain\r\nRobox NFC chip scanning: transferring ARWEAVE\/IPFS data onto physical NFC chips\r\n\r\nIn a simple visualization, this is what we will be achieving:\r\n\r\nPattern \u2192 CNC machine \u2192 Automatic product metadata \u2192 Blockchain smart certification\r\n\r\nIn a more detailed overview, it will look like this:\r\n\r\nZero Waste Certified Pattern \u2013[zero knowledge smart contract]\u2192 Zero Waste Certified Manufacturer \u2192 Manufacturing metadata captured [FOAM, ARWEAVE, IPFS]\u2192 Smart Certification issued \u2192 scanned onto halo chip [MFOS, ROBOX, KONG] \u2192 Customer scans chip on phone [ERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\t5.) Team\/partners:\r\n\r\nZWDC: Danielle, Cass, Myl\u00e8ne, Holly- certification acting body\r\n\r\nPattern Project UK: Simon and Shruti- CNC metadata developers\r\n\r\nKONG: Self-sovereign NFT chip manufacturer\r\n\r\nIYK: Visual software designers for visual interaction through ERS\r\n\r\nMetafactory: MFOS and Robox- metadata storage, product linking & Kong chip scanning\r\n\r\n\r\n\t6. Conclusion:\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the case for on-chain smart certifications and automatic metadata capture is our best tool in fighting greenwashing and making the greatest impact on our climate.\r\n\r\nJoin us in building a substantive future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If you would like your donation to have the maximum impact, please postpone the donation until the next Gitcoin Grants matching round begins. Thank you!\r\n\r\n\u201cWho looks outside dreams; who looks inside awakes.\u201d\r\n\r\n-C.G. Jung Letters, Vol. 1: 1906-1950\r\n\r\nThe Neuroscience of Ethereum is a framework based on First Principles, and it can be applied to advance our understanding of Ethereum. It can also be applied to understand how Neuromodulation is the \"bicycle for the brain\" - stay tuned for the next round. \r\n\u00a0\r\nIn web3 and Ethereum, we are endowed with Freedom of Transaction: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis unlocks coordination possibilities that are, in many ways, beyond the scope of imagination. E.g., we can build a society in which health insurance companies are no longer the gate-keepers of TMS prior authorizations. Our patients no longer have to jump through hoops and holes in order to receive this life-transforming intervention.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOn Ethereum, we can leverage smart contracts and Elastic Finance (more below) to stream Neuro-Cognitive Liquidity into the Nervous System with Neuromodulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and other forms of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPrevious updates:\r\n\r\nBecause\u00a0Ethereum is a Model of the World, we will consequently glean many insights about our Universe (and Metaverse). Crucially,\u00a0in-sights\u00a0about the Nervous System map on to the Ethereum Network with uncanny and striking resemblances.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne of the most important insights is\u00a0Elasticity.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMuch like ETH exhibits properties of Moneyness...\r\n\r\n\r\n...Neurotransmitters, too, function like Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, adjustments to market demand are made by modulating the\u00a0Supply\u00a0of Neurotransmitters (Store of Value; left), and not their \u201cPrice\u201d \u2013 the degree of change induced in the resting membrane potential of the neuron (Unit of Account; right) by excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) or inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). Hence, the Nervous System appears to be organized under an Elastic Finance System.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative we apply these insights towards Elastic Finance.\r\n\r\nSeptember is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. Earlier this year, several people\u00a0died by suicide\u00a0following the LUNA debacle. Many others lost their life savings. The implosion rippled far throughout the ecosystem and spared no one, as the market witnessed cascading liquidations sending the price of ETH all the way down to $888. The greed of the few induced the misfortune of many. Without any tools to monitor the\u00a0cognitive taxes from financial insecurity constraints\u00a0levied on everyone, we can only guess the degree of aggregate loss to society.\r\n\r\nWe must do better. Decentralized Finance has transformed many lives, but it is far from perfect. If we are going to successfully build a better world with web3 technology, then we will require a more stable financial system. Thankfully, there are solutions.\r\n\r\nZero Liquidation Loans in Elastic Finance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy adhering to the Scientific Process, we source Truth from the World. The Ethereum Network and the Nervous System are both Truth sourcing entities. Examined through the lens of Active Inference in Systems Neuroscience, the Ethereum Network and our Neuronal Networks appear to be\u00a0causally\u00a0modeling each other:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThis unfolds as the Nervous System sources Truth from the world continuously in real time, by converting disorder into order; information entropy into certainty. Thus, we can model Ethereum after the Nervous System in this way in order to source Truth from the world, and securely add it to our shared public good \u2013 the distributed ledger. Now that Ethereum has scaled with its own Layer 2 solutions, this security can empower us to confidently source Truths and Decentralize Science. Through consensus at unprecedented scale on Ethereum, we can plausibly attempt GameFi solutions: e.g.,\u00a0Sleep 2 Earn\u00a0to reverse the Sleep Epidemic, or\u00a0Heal 2 Earn\u00a0to gamify healthy living, or optimizing cognition with Neuromodulation, or some combination\/evolution thereof. All catalyzed by data collection from individuals around the world, and the resultant data token tsunami of liquidity finding its way to Ethereum DeFi. That is one pathway to bootstrapping a human node network.\r\n\r\nBelow follows a very broad overview of this framework:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Imagine if we can treat depression with an off-patent psychedelic-assisted therapy or cancer with a ketogenic diet?\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrowd Funded Cures is an Open Source Medical Impact DAO (partnered with VitaDAO, Molecule, PsyDAO, & LabDAO and receiving advisory support from Protocol Labs and the Health Impact Fund), whose mission is to create a financially innovative Impact Market to re-align private incentives in the medical industry away from monopoly-priced patented medicines and towards low-cost, open-source therapies that can treat and potentially cure millions of patients and improve global health and well-being.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have two grants. The one you are reading is our grant application for the Open Source Medical Prize Fund of the Medical Impact DAO, Crowd Funded Cures. We have a separate grant application for our Medical Impact DAO, which you can find here: https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7518\/medical-impact-dao-to-govern-retroactive-funding-o\r\n\r\nCurrently, 1000s of otherwise viable unmonopolizable therapies are ignored by the pharmaceutical industry because a monopoly price cannot be enforced. We call them public good medicines because once the treatment protocol is published, it is not possible to stop people accessing the therapy from multiple sources (non-excludable) and use of the treatment protocol does not prevent others from using it (non-rivalrous). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this causes a tragedy of the commons which means that pharma companies will not fund the large clinical trials needed for them to be reimbursed by health insurers or obtain regulatory approval. Governments and health insurers also do not want to take on the political risk of paying for large clinical trials in case they fail, which means these treatments will typically not be accepted by the mainstream medical establishment. They include repurposed off-patent generic drugs, supplements, plant medicines, psychedelics, diets, and non-pharmaceutical \/ lifestyle interventions.\r\n\r\nWe can solve this tragedy of the commons and provide a high impact use case for society that unlocks billions of dollars in social value for relatively low cost by establishing an Impact Market that incentivises impact investors to fund IP-NFTs representing public good medicines. Successful clinical trial data that validates the safety and efficacy of such public good medicines converts the IP-NFTs into Hypercerts eligible to receive outcome payments from a crowdfunded Open Source Medical Prize Fund proportional to improved patient outcomes validated in clinical trials (see Medical Prize fund figure below). The Impact Market also de-risks the funding of clinical trials for donors \/ public. The result would be that investors fund new public good medicines that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and available to the entire global community at low cost, while obtaining a standard return on investment. \r\n\r\nHowever, in order to bring this open source business model to pharma, we need to crowdfund a source of retroactive (and quadratic) funding of the Impact Market through our Medical Prize Fund. Together, by supporting an Open Source Medical Prize Fund, the community can usher in a new era of medicine which does not ignore otherwise viable therapies because they are not profitable under the traditional patent system. Unlike donations to traditional charities (which often receive the majority of their funding from big pharma), through this novel \u201cpay-for-success\u201d mechanism, you can also be sure that your donations will only fund successful clinical trials.\r\n\r\nThe following presentation by founder Savva Kerdemelidis at DeSci Berlin hosted by Molecule on 24 May 2022 explains the problem of this tragedy of the commons and how to solve it using \"prize-like\" Pay-For-Success contracts x IP-NFTs to create an impact market for open source medicine:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Prize Fund Key Takeaways\r\n\r\nWhere's my donation going? \r\n\r\nYour donations will go towards an Open Source Medical Prize Fund. This general fund will provide a source of retroactive (and quadratic) funding of specific Open Source Medical Prizes in specific therapeutic classes\u00a0e.g.\u00a0Open Longevity Prize Fund, Open Psychedelic Depression Prize Fund, Open Glioblastoma Prize Fund and others. \r\n\r\nSpecific pilot Open Medical Prize Fund categories we are supporting:\r\n\r\nOpen Longevity Prize Fund: Together with VitaDAO and Lifespan.io, we are supporting the idea of an Open Longevity Prize Fund to incentivise repurposing of generic drug and and other unmonopolizable therapies to improve healthy longevity using a standard functional strength biomarker such as the 30-second chair stand test, which is correlated with healthy longevity. For example, Dr. Stanfield\u2019s Phase 2a proof-of-concept designed to assess the safety, tolerability, feasibility, and trial design of weekly rapamycin (generic drug) + exercise vs. placebo. Our fundraising goal is $10m.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOpen Psychedelic Depression Prize Fund: Together with PsyDAO and The Ketamine Task Force, we are helping raise funding for a clinical trial that will assess the superior efficacy and safety of racemic generic \"Open Ketamine\" for treatment-resistant depression, which costs less than $10 a course vs. esketamine which that is the left-handed molecule of racemic ketamine, and costs approximately $12,000 dollars because it is patented. Ultimately we want to ensure that patients can access safe and affordable generic ketamine treatments by providing an impact market to incentivise successful clinical trials. Our fundraising goal is $10m.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOpen Glioblastoma Prize Fund: Glioblastoma (otherwise known as a brain tumour) is one of the deadliest cancers, with less than 10% chance of survival over 5 years from diagnosis. However, there are many public good therapies that may be more effective than other patented medicines. Crowd Funded Cures want to establish an Open Glioblastoma Prize Fund to support the fundraising efforts of non-profit organisations such as Gillies McIndoe Research Institute which has been very supportive of our mission and is fundraising for a Phase 2 randomised controlled trial to use generic drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors) to treat glioblastoma. It is also possible that a ketogenic diet may help treat or even cure cancers such as glioblastoma, due to cancer cells requiring 10x more glucose than other cells, and so are starved by a ketogenic diet. Our fundraising goal is $10m.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOpen COVID Prize Fund: The Covid pandemic has killed millions of people and caused trillions of dollars in economic damage. Early in the pandemic, off-patent drugs such as HCQ and ivermectin were promoted as potential treatments and cures, with billions of dollars in public funding spent, but scientists still arguing over efficacy, mainly over political rather than scientific lines. Meanwhile, there are various low cost off-patent treatments like dexamethasone, which have received less attention, but could be effective treatments for Covid and other respiratory illnesses, e.g. fluvoxamine, budesonide, BCG vaccine, L-arginine, and others. \r\n\r\nFuture clinical projects in our pipeline:\r\nWe actively engage with our DAO, community and external partners to understand where the biggest impact is with public good medicines (e.g. high cost indications such as treating end-stage kidney disease and Crohn\u2019s disease with diet).\u00a0\r\n\r\nProblem: A Lack of Incentives for the Clinical Development of Public Good Medicines\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry\u2019s reliance on patents have led to a massive market failure: affordable and potentially life saving therapies are missing the incentives for robust clinical evaluation and development, ultimately keeping potential cures out of the hands of patients.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn estimated 7500 generic drugs and 50,000+ nutraceuticals, plant medicines, diets and lifestyle interventions could be studied to treat and potentially cure diseases for 1\/100th of the cost and up to 10x faster than patented drugs as their safety profile and often mechanism of actions are known from use over many years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, without monopolistic pricing and\/or royalties secured by patent protection, investors are unable to get a return on their investment for the large Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that identify new therapeutic uses for these treatments, so these treatments have almost zero chance of getting the funding needed to gain regulatory approval and be prescribed by physicians.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe therefore need new ways to fund these Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to get these therapeutics to patients.\r\n\r\nSolution: Our Medical Prize Fund Incentivizes Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials of Public Good Medicines\r\n\r\nGitcoin Grants supports the development of open-source tools by providing direct crowdfunding or \u201cpush\u201d incentives. Impact Markets transfer the risk of funding clinical trials to impact investors, by crowdfunding a Medical Prize Fund that acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding \u201cpull\u201d incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for patients that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative, but ignored by the pharmaceutical industry. RCTs are used to compare the treatment to a placebo or standard of care to determine if the treatment is effective.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase 1 RCTs are to determine safety, and typically not required for public good medicines such as generic drugs, nutraceuticals, plant medicines or diets which have already passed Phase 1 or are generally recognised as safe (GRAS) compounds. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 RCTs are typically more than 100 patients and used to establish efficacy - these are also typically at the highest risk of failure (e.g. 50%). Phase 3 clinical trials assess the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic regimen and are required to get regulatory approval and market access of those therapies, so physicians can prescribe them to patients. These typically comprise more than 1000 patients. \r\n\r\nRCTs must be conducted by independent Contract Research Organizations (CROs) to ensure high quality and exclude manipulation. Regarding costs, a good rule of thumb is around $10k per patient, but can vary by indication (e.g. cancer RCTs might cost $50k or more per patient, due to the requirement of ongoing tests and monitoring). RCT treatment protocols must also be pre-approved by the Medical Impact DAO to ensure ethics approval.\r\n\r\nGo-to-Market\r\n\r\nStage 1: Medical Impact DAO crowdfunds Medical \u201cDe-Risking\u201d Prize Fund for Retrospective Funding of Phase 2 RCTs (see Figure 1 below)\r\n\r\nStep 1. \r\n\r\nThe Medical Prize Fund will be supported by crowdfunding and sales of Medical Impact NFTs.\r\n\r\nStep 2. \r\n\r\nIP-NFTs are then minted to secure funding from impact investors for Phase 2 RCTs that generate treatment protocols with the most impact, as measured by % improved clinical outcomes vs. standard of care, which will be allocated impact points that determine the right to receive outcome payments from the Medical Impact Fund, through a flexible prize mechanism (e.g. 50% improvement in clinical outcomes vs usual care provides 50 impact points).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe higher the impact, the more impact points and more proportion of the annual 20% outcome payment received. This incentivizes incremental improvements and medical breakthroughs and \u201cde-risks\u201d Phase 2 RCTs. \r\n\r\nIt also means that the Medical Prize Fund is scalable - the larger it is the more RCTs are registered before \u201cmarket equilibium\u201d is reached. This also ensures the efficient pricing and delivery of impact by the markets.\r\n\r\nTreatment protocols that are less efficacious\/safe than standard of care will not be rewarded.\r\n\r\nStep 3. \r\n\r\nSuccessful clinical trial data validating safety and efficacy of a certain treatment protocol converts IP-NFTs to Hypercerts which has the right to register to the fund and receive outcome payments for a period of time (e.g 5 years), proportional to Impact Points generated, as validated by an independent contract research organization and multisig oracle. IP-NFTs owners receive exclusivity over their treatment protocol, as long as they are actively conducting the RCT. \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. We transfer the risk of funding clinical trials to impact investors, by crowdfunding a Medical Prize Fund that acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding \u201cpull\u201d incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for patients that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Medical Impact DAO establishes Public Good Pharma Ltd to negotiate Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) for funding Phase 3 RCTs needed for Regulatory Approval of Public Good Medicines (see Figure 2 below)\r\n\r\nOnce the optimal treatment protocol for Phase 2 RCTs is obtained by the Medical Impact DAO (see Stage 1 above), a Public Good Pharma company owned by the Medical Impact DAO will negotiate Advanced Market Commitments from Payers, e.g., healthcare payers - private and public - government, etc. ensure that funding the Phase 3 RCTs are rewarded with an exclusive commitment to purchase a \u201cbranded\u201d therapy, e.g., $100m for Open Ketamine for treatment-resistant depression. The Public Good Pharma company can also leverage method of use \/ dosing regime patents and reformulations to strengthen its IP position although these would primarily be enforceable against payers but not against doctors and patients (hence the tragedy of the commons) - so open source is \"baked-into\" the model.\r\n\r\nAMCs provide financial incentives for Impact Investors to back a Phase 3 RCT which costs around $50m, and also conduct post marketing surveillance to check the therapy\u2019s performance in real life scenarios, to study the long-term risks and benefits of using the therapy and to discover any rare side effects.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the AMC will be less than the cost savings for Payers that successful treatment protocols derived from these clinical trials provide, which allows the business model to scale.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs part of the Advanced Market Commitment, Phase 3 RCTs that fail to show efficacy\/safety vs. standard of care will not receive a payout from the AMC. \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2.

		"description": "Imagine if we can treat depression with an off-patent psychedelic-assisted therapy or cancer with a ketogenic diet?\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrowd Funded Cures is an Open Source Medical Impact DAO (partnered with VitaDAO, Molecule, PsyDAO, & LabDAO and receiving advisory support from Protocol Labs and the Health Impact Fund) whose mission is to create a financially innovative Impact Market to re-align private incentives in the medical industry away from monopoly-priced patented medicines and towards low-cost, open-source therapies that can treat and potentially cure millions of patients and improve global health and well-being.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have two grants. The one you are reading is our grant application for the Open Source Medical Impact DAO, Crowd Funded Cures. We have a separate grant application for our Medical Prize Fund, which you can find here: https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7516\/open-source-medical-prize-fund-for-retroactive-fu\r\n\r\nCurrently, 1000s of otherwise viable unmonopolizable therapies are ignored by the pharmaceutical industry because a monopoly price cannot be enforced. We call them public good medicines because once the treatment protocol is published, it is not possible to stop people accessing the therapy from multiple sources (non-excludable) and use of the treatment protocol does not prevent others from using it (non-rivalrous). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this causes a tragedy of the commons which means that pharma companies will not fund the large clinical trials needed for them to be reimbursed by health insurers or obtain regulatory approval. Governments and health insurers also do not want to take on the political risk of paying for large clinical trials in case they fail, which means these treatments will typically not be accepted by the mainstream medical establishment. They include repurposed off-patent generic drugs, supplements, plant medicines, psychedelics, diets, and non-pharmaceutical \/ lifestyle interventions.\r\n\r\nWe can solve this tragedy of the commons and provide a high impact use case for web3 that unlocks billions of dollars in social value for relatively low cost by establishing an Impact Market that incentivises impact investors to fund IP-NFTs representing public good medicines. Successful clinical trial data that validates the safety and efficacy of such public good medicines converts the IP-NFTs into Hypercerts eligible to receive outcome payments from a crowdfunded Open Source Medical Prize Fund proportional to improved patient outcomes validated in clinical trials (see Medical Prize fund figure below). The Impact Market also de-risks the funding of clinical trials for donors \/ public. The result would be that investors fund new public good medicines that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and available to the entire global community at low cost, while obtaining a standard return on investment. \r\n\r\nHowever, in order to bring this open source business model to pharma, we need to crowdfund a source of retroactive (and quadratic) funding of the Impact Market through our Medical Prize Fund, which is governed by our Medical Impact DAO. Together, by supporting our Medical Impact DAO, the community can usher in a new era of medicine which does not ignore otherwise viable therapies because they are not profitable under the traditional patent system. Unlike donations to traditional charities (which often receive the majority of their funding from big pharma), through this novel \u201cpay-for-success\u201d mechanism, you can also be sure that your donations will only fund successful clinical trials.\r\n\r\nThe following presentation by founder Savva Kerdemelidis at DeSci Berlin hosted by Molecule on 24 May 2022 explains the problem of this tragedy of the commons and how to solve it using \"prize-like\" Pay-For-Success contracts x IP-NFTs to create an impact market for open source medicine:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour GR15 donations will be used to:\r\n\r\n1. Build out the core infrastructure for our Medical Impact DAO, which will govern our Medical Prize Fund, a source of retroactive funding for Phase 2 clinical trials of public good medicines.\r\n\r\n2. Support our operating expenses and key contributors to build out the DAO infrastructure and achieve milestones, as described below.\r\n\r\nProblem: A Lack of Incentives for the Clinical Development of Public Good Medicines\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry\u2019s reliance on patents have led to a massive market failure: affordable and potentially life saving therapies are missing the incentives for robust clinical evaluation and development, ultimately keeping potential cures out of the hands of patients.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn estimated 7500 generic drugs and 50,000+ nutraceuticals, plant medicines, diets and lifestyle interventions could be studied to treat and potentially cure diseases for 1\/100th of the cost and up to 10x faster than patented drugs as their safety profile and often mechanism of actions are known from use over many years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, without monopolistic pricing and\/or royalties secured by patent protection, investors are unable to get a return on their investment for the large Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that identify new therapeutic uses for these treatments, so these treatments have almost zero chance of getting the funding needed to gain regulatory approval and be prescribed by physicians.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe therefore need new ways to fund these Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to get these therapeutics to patients.\r\n\r\nSolution: Our Medical Prize Fund Incentivizes Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials of Public Good Medicines\r\n\r\nGitcoin Grants supports the development of open-source tools by providing direct crowdfunding or \u201cpush\u201d incentives. Impact Markets transfer the risk of funding clinical trials to impact investors, by crowdfunding a Medical Prize Fund that acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding \u201cpull\u201d incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for patients that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative, but ignored by the pharmaceutical industry. RCTs are used to compare the treatment to a placebo or standard of care to determine if the treatment is effective.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase 1 RCTs are to determine safety, and typically not required for public good medicines such as generic drugs, nutraceuticals, plant medicines or diets which have already passed Phase 1 or are generally recognised as safe (GRAS) compounds. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 RCTs are typically more than 100 patients and used to establish efficacy - these are also typically at the highest risk of failure (e.g. 50%). \r\n\r\nPhase 3 RCTs assess the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic regimen and are required to get regulatory approval and market access of those therapies, so physicians can prescribe them to patients. These typically comprise more than 1000 patients. \r\n\r\nRCTs must be conducted by independent Contract Research Organisations (CROs) to ensure high quality and exclude manipulation. Regarding costs, a good rule of thumb is around $10k per patient, but can vary by indication (e.g. cancer RCTs might cost $50k or more per patient, due to the requirement of ongoing tests and monitoring). \r\n\r\nRCT treatment protocols must also be pre-approved by the Medical Impact DAO to ensure ethics approval.\r\n\r\nGo-To-Market\r\n\r\nStage 1: Medical Impact DAO crowdfunds Medical \u201cDe-Risking\u201d Prize Fund for Retrospective Funding of Phase 2 RCTs (see Figure 1 below)\r\n\r\nStep 1. \r\n\r\nThe Medical Prize Fund will be supported by crowdfunding and sales of Medical Impact NFTs.\r\n\r\nStep 2. \r\n\r\nIP-NFTs are then minted to secure funding from impact investors for Phase 2 RCTs that generate treatment protocols with the most impact, as measured by % improved clinical outcomes vs. standard of care, which will be allocated impact points that determine the right to receive outcome payments from the Medical Impact Fund, through a flexible prize mechanism (e.g. 50% improvement in clinical outcomes vs usual care provides 50 impact points).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe higher the impact, the more impact points and more proportion of the annual 20% outcome payment received. This incentivizes incremental improvements and medical breakthroughs and \u201cde-risks\u201d Phase 2 RCTs and to determine the optimal treatment protocol for a public good medicine. \r\n\r\nIt also means that the Medical Prize Fund is scalable - the larger it is the more RCTs are registered before \u201cmarket equilibium\u201d is reached. This also ensures the efficient pricing and delivery of impact by the markets.\r\n\r\nTreatment protocols that are less efficacious\/safe than standard of care will not be rewarded.\r\n\r\nStep 3. \r\n\r\nSuccessful clinical trial data validating safety and efficacy of a certain treatment protocol converts IP-NFTs to Hypercerts which has the rights to register to the fund and receive outcome payments for a period of time (e.g 5 years), proportional to Impact Points generated, as validated by an independent contract research organization and multisig oracle. IP-NFTs owners receive exclusivity over their treatment protocol, as long as they are actively conducting the RCT. \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Our Medical Prize Fund  acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding \u201cpull\u201d incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for public good medicines that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Medical Impact DAO establishes Public Good Pharma Ltd to negotiate Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) for funding Phase 3 RCTs needed for Regulatory Approval of Public Good Medicines (see Figure 2 below)\r\n\r\nOnce the optimal treatment protocol for Phase 2 RCTs is obtained by the Medical Impact DAO (see Stage 1 above), a Public Good Pharma company owned by the Medical Impact DAO will negotiate Advanced Market Commitments from Payers, e.g., healthcare payers - private and public - government, etc. ensure that funding the Phase 3 RCTs are rewarded with an exclusive commitment to purchase a \u201cbranded\u201d therapy, e.g., $100m for Open Ketamine for treatment-resistant depression. The Public Good Pharma company can also leverage method of use \/ dosing regime patents and reformulations to strengthen its IP position although these would primarily be enforceable against payers but not against doctors and patients (hence the tragedy of the commons) - so open source is \"baked-into\" the model. \r\n\r\nAMCs provide financial incentives for Impact Investors to back a Phase 3 RCT which costs around $50m, and also conduct post marketing surveillance to check the therapy\u2019s performance in real life scenarios, to study the long-term risks and benefits of using the therapy and to discover any rare side effects.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the AMC will be less than the cost savings for Payers that successful treatment protocols derived from these clinical trials provide, which allows the business model to scale.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs part of the Advanced Market Commitment, Phase 3 RCTs that fail to show efficacy\/safety vs. standard of care will not receive a payout from the AMC. \r\n\r\nFigure 2.

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7525\/starksheet-the-web3-spreadsheet",
		"description": "Own your business intelligence, and get the full value out of it!\r\n\r\nWhile spreadsheet is the usual goto tool for creating (simple to complex) models (we love spreadsheets), they're like your fav. web2 social network: you eventually don't own the logic you're creating.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the complex intrication of data, functions and calls in between cells stays stuck in the proprietary software you're using (Google sheet or Microsoft Excel most probably). Not only is the data stuck, but your capacity to use data or functions from the outer world is dramatically constrained.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, you cannot control the intelligent software you created, you cannot easily migrate it, nor analyze it, etc. It's like if a dev couldn't keep a copy of their code out of the text editor they used to write it, nor could they deploy their program whenever and wherever they wanted!\r\n\r\nStarksheet solves this by relying only on on-chain data and functions:\r\neverything that the user generates is stored as NFT owned by the user\r\nevery function ever deployed to the blockchain can be used in a cell\r\nno forced migration\r\nno software's built-in features constraint: built-in features are everything available on-chain, with constantly new features added as the ecosystem evolves\r\n\r\nConsequently, the model (the knowledge graph) underlying your work in the spreadsheet stays yours, simply yours. This graph can be used anywhere else, simultaneously by several dApps (like in a company, everyone could work on their fav. front end while indeed using and editing the same data).\r\n\r\nThis graph can also be easily analyzed in real-time by some machine learning algorithms that could:\r\nestimate (human) error impact on each cell (each node) to help you prune useless task and put the effort where it matters\r\ncompute sensibility of a given output to corresponding inputs\r\ncompare to other graphs (other companies' intelligence) to detect oddities\r\n\r\nQuality comes with responsibility\r\n\r\nAt Starksheet we believe that tools don't replace best practices. In other words you can do a good work with a bad tool and good practices but you cannot expect anything good from an awesome tool with bad practices.\r\n\r\nWe then think that the best way to achieve data consistency at scale for a company is to make anyone responsible for their (small) chunk of data. Using NFT ownership as a marker of responsibility for this single piece of data\/compute lets anyone raise their bar and the quality of the company data lake on the whole. Because everything is linked.\r\n\r\nThe right interface to democratize blockchain tools\r\n\r\nThough the blockchain is a huge shared stated, the end regular-non-geek user of any dApp hasn't realized yet that dApps are just a front-end built by the same team that did the smart contract. In other word, they can interact with the underlying application without using the site, because it's here, on-chain, and so can be used directly.\r\n\r\nWe actually saw people pledging for a \"etherscan\" skill, meaning they are confident heading to the read\/write contract tabs and click in some buttons without (too much) fear.\r\n\r\nThis is bad and not what we consider a democratized tool. In this spirit, starksheet can also be seen as a 360\u00b0 revamp of the contract tabs of a block explorer:\r\na familiar interface to use and create data\r\njust type in the contract name and benefit from a usual auto complete of the available functions\r\nuse the output of one call into another one (like A1=token.ownerOf(1), B1=otherToken.balanceOf(A1))\r\nbookmark these calls in a neat dashboard\r\n\r\nAll together, starksheet aims at being a true general purpose workplace for the common user, not interested especially in web3 but whose adoption is driven by a gain in productivity and privacy.\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n\r\nStarksheet is actually not only an idea but is live on Starknet mainnet already. The genesis of the idea goes back to mid-may 2022 and we spent 2 months implementing it.\r\n\r\nBefore this project, we already worked as a team in an on-chain NFT project called The Chain Dreamers (https:\/\/chaindreamers.xyz\/).\r\n\r\nWe actually all met in a web agency based in Paris (FR) where:\r\nCl\u00e9ment worked as a Machine Learning Engineer\r\nGeorges worked as a Full Stack dev\r\nJason worked as a Agile Coach\/Product manager and later developed the no-code business unit\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n\r\nWe successfully launched our PoC on Starknet mainnet in mid-august. You can read here about its usage.\r\nThe roadmap now splits into three categories, see also our notion board:\r\n\r\nNo-code tool: improving the UX of the app\r\nInfra\r\nuse L3 scaling\r\nuse account abstraction\r\nsolve slow RPC providers issue\r\nGeneralization\r\nport starksheet to other L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon\r\nport starksheet to all EVM compatible blockchain\r\nport starksheet to other ecosystem (NEAR, Solana)\r\n\r\nThe prioritization in between these three categories will be discussed with our community, please feel free to reach out to us to say \"hi\", give your thoughts or contribute to some of the developments!",

		"description": "Barterchain is a peer to peer barter platform where members can trade their talents, swap their skills and earn rewards. We\u2019re moving completely away from Fiat - and connecting human gifts with human needs, so that we may all live in greater abundance.\r\n\r\nThis platform is providing the infrastructure for communities and ecosystems to exchange value - in a transparent, secure, reliable way. It facilitates both inter and intra community bartering - meaning ecosystem members can barter amongst themselves, OR with members of other projects and protocols.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe fundamental problem we\u2019re addressing is that so many people in 2022 find themselves cash-poor. They may be time-rich or skill-rich, but being cash-poor means there are so many things they can\u2019t afford. Barter however allows members to outsource tasks, learn new skills, and connect with others authentically, all while saving money. So the benefits range from financial to social, for an individual, household, business or community.\r\n\u00a0\r\nUsing blockchain technology, tokenization, matchmaking algorithms and machine learning - we\u2019re also enabling users to go beyond the restrictions of traditional barter. We\u2019re solving the age-old problems associated with barter trade, as well as personal problems for our users. Because we truly believe that NOW is the time to bridge the oldest form of trade, into the newest.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThroughout history barter has always increased \u201cduring times of economic recession and inflation\u201d (Cambridge Press, 1986) and given the current economic climate, we believe global barter is needed more than ever. We\u2019re using blockchain for social and public good, giving members egalitarian access to the services they need, regardless of the economic climate, or their personal financial situation.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo fuel this great barter comeback and scale this platform for mass adoption, we\u2019ll need funding - and we want you to be a part of this! Let\u2019s challenge the status quo and bring back barter together - bridging the oldest form of trade into the newest - barter 3.0.",

		"description": "Bio\r\n\r\nRektify AI is an AI-powered Web3 security & risk analytics platform offering attack literacy, vulnerability detection & intrusion prevention for crypto projects & users.\r\n\r\nHacks, scams, and exploits are not nascent to the blockchain space; attacks cause projects and users billions of dollars each year creating opportunities for more ameliorate security solutions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJust in the past 2 years, we've lost more than $16 billion in attacks in the blockchain industry, which is projected to double by the year 2026. Both projects and end-users want to protect themselves so we offer suites for both customers. The data portals are intended to be used by end-users to connect their wallets and receive access to risk dashboards. For projects, we offer affordable smart contract auditing and access to our API that stores historical time-series data and on-chain activity pertaining to Web3 attacks.\r\n\r\nRecently, we just received more validation from the blockchain industry by winning TRON Grand Hackathon. This global hackathon was comprised of over 2000 teams\/devs competing all over the world. We tied in 3rd place for the DeFi category with SlowMist, a blockchain security company that started back in 2018.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat are we building?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re an analytics tool for crypto end-users and an affordable smart contract auditing service for crypto projects.\u00a0The goal of the data portal (analytics tool) is the track risk metrics associated with certain projects, i.e., doxxed project founders, # of audits, quality of documentation, existence period, chain, roadmap, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data portal shows displays risk metrics that users would have garnered by doing \u201cDYOR\u201d. But the challenge is, that newcomers and even people who have participated in crypto for a while don't know what they don't know, and more importantly, don't know what specifics to research when discerning project risk. We took an academic and data analytic approach to this issue. We\u2019ve democratized DYOR with a hint of analytics, de-risking users\u2019 investment strategies.\r\n\r\nWhy will we win?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re an analytics platform for crypto end-users and projects; we\u2019re a team of data scientists, DeFi analysts, developers, and cybersecurity specialists that have been in the blockchain industry for over 6 years. Our founder is a data scientist and machine learning engineer who has worked at NASA Goddard, Glenn Research Center, Langley Research Center, and Jet Propulsion Lab throughout college. Post-college, 2021, she worked at Maxar Technologies analyzing adversarial attacks deployed on NLP machine learning models and she worked in DeFi insurance. The ethos for why she began Rektify AI, was to attack the real issue in crypto, which is sifting out bugs in code for project development teams and bringing security tooling and education to end-users, rather than charging crypto users harsh premiums to be insured. Unfortunately, crypto has experienced a plethora of insanity by institutions\/protocols orchestrating the same malpractices in traditional finance over and over again, and expecting a different result. This abuse and malpractice is not a secret to subsections of the blockchain industry and legitimate project development teams and their users need protection.\r\n\r\nOne of our data-driven projects, REAL API, is the largest API of hacks, scams, and exploits in crypto powered by NLP. We showcased it briefly in our TRON Grand Hackathon proposal. Please check it out and like the DevPost link!\r\n\r\nWhat have we figured out so far?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve found product market fit on a small scale with 50+ independent crypto users (NFT collectors,\u00a0DeFi investors, etc.) waitlisted for our user data portal and global project development teams outsourcing our smart contract auditing service.\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n\r\nThe Gitcoin Grant will help support our development team. We are allocating 20% of the funds for decentralized storage credits, GPU credits, and data analytics subscriptions (Tableau, Rill Data). With the Gitcoin Grant, we will be able to hit our milestones faster so that our project roadmap is on-time. Lastly, this support will go to the development of our MVP showcased above. Our next goal is to garner 10,000 users on the waitlist and have 5-10% become beta testers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7536\/truust-a-proposed-new-computational-model-as-an-a",
		"description": "TL;DR\r\nWhat is this project?\r\nHow the brain is able to achieve hyper-computation, whereas traditional Turing machine based computers can not, is of critical importance to all of humanity and more specifically to all of science & engineering. This project's aim is to test the existence of a physical phenomena hypothesized to form the basis for hyper-computation in the brain.\u00a0This physical phenomena is only possible if a universe exists testable by a proposed computing device whose model is beyond the Turing based paradigm. The proposed architecture is informed in part by prior work which found evidence from novel neuro-imaging techniques that led to a brief research period at CERN. \r\n\r\nWhat will the funding for this project provide?\r\nThe funding for this project will provide for labor & materials to test a so far unexplored interpretation of reality, which if successful will enable efforts to develop a new computational model beyond Turing machine based architecture to scale. The labor component will comprise 6 fte optical scientists & algorithms engineers to work together for a period of 2-3 years developing a prototype computing device using the materials. The materials component will comprise optical & electronic equipment. \r\nThe experimental validation will be to test whether or not the computing device can mine a block of bitcoin faster than otherwise possible.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy is this project the right thing to focus on?\r\nThis is the right thing to focus on because as Adam Becker highlights in his book 'What is Real?' a foundational question key to progress in Physics has been overlooked.\u00a0All of humanity's conflict is attributed to how best to source, process and distribute resources. We don't believe such conflict is solve-able via organizational behavior. Only a breakthrough in devising a computational model beyond Turing which can elicit subsequent technological progress such that a paretotopian goal aligned outcome is possible can stave off likely catastrophe to come from resource conflicts on Earth. The proposed project to develop & test a proposed computational model beyond Turing is directly related to the foundational question Becker refers to. If successful, the experimental validation will provide for an indisputable marker that the device has reached supremacy and that the universe works in a retrocausal manner.\u00a0If unsuccessful, the experimental result will provide for scientific knowledge that this path is not the way forward. \r\n\r\nIf this project is successful, Cui bono?\r\nThere is a large and growing library of algorithms for applications of breakthrough innovation like self-driving cars, AGI, CAD that exist but which cannot run because hardware capable of running them does not exist. The data volume and complexity of these workloads is beyond what is possible to today's GPU's and all forms of advanced Turing based compute. What is needed is a new computational model. If this project is successful, scientists and engineers who have developed such algorithms, and users of their resultant applications, would benefit. As well, scientific researchers working downstream from fundamental Physics would benefit, as if this model of computation works, it would say something specific about the foundational question in Physics referenced in Becker's book. \r\n\r\nHow does this project fit with DeSci?\r\nThis project fits within DeSci as all progress in science & engineering depends on a breakthrough at this level, without which desired applications elsewhere will not be possible as today's Turing machine based computers can't process information fast enough to deliver the desired applications. Further this project is unlikely to be funded elsewhere given systemic issues with how capital is allocated in scientific research. As well, all known other research efforts in this domain are failing. \r\n\u00a0\r\nMOTIVATION\r\nIt's a little known reality that current forms of computing are limited in terms of ability to compute fast enough to solve problem types critical for continued technological progress. This issue is beyond what most people think of in respect to so-called Moore's Law. This issue is referred to technically as the Turing barrier and attempts to develop new computational models to move beyond Turing is a research domain technically known as hyper-computing.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIMPACT\r\nThis area of research has high impact because all technological progress depends on a breakthrough in this research domain. Without which, all of science & engineering, not to mention the global economy, will be limited in terms of the types of applications which can be brought to bear. Thus the outcome trajectory of delivering such a breakthrough is either leveling up our species' place on the Kardashev scale or being faced with a evolutionary dark age with corresponding catastrophe to accompany such an outcome. When you evaluate where capital flows in this research domain, controlled for the theoretical perspective of the physics that needs to hold for these systems to work, you become alarmed to find that all capital is only going towards two of the potentially three ways to construct these systems.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGOAL\r\nOur proposal is based on an original discovery regarding how the brain achieves hyper-computation. This discovery led to a brief research period at CERN and we subscribe that the only way the observed phenomenon could be real is if a specific so far unexplored interpretation of physics is the way forward. We propose developing a new computing device whose successful computation would only be possible if this were true. The technical term for what we propose is known as counterfactual hyper-computing.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHISTORY & OTHER DETAILS\r\nReaching the Turing barrier means no more technological progress, no matter the computational power available, which has known adverse outcomes in terms of economy and society, the effort to develop a new computational model beyond Turing is known as hyper-computing.\r\nThese are classes of problems where even a universe sized computer, one composed of all the matter in the universe, that ran for the length of the universe, wouldn't compute fast enough (i.e. self-driving cars, AGI, classic traveling salesman problem, designing systems for more efficient space travel\/energy\/medical applications, etc.).\r\nIn an effort to uncover inspiration for a new computational model, the PI developed software (30s video:\u00a0https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rhRwpAA1KeA) which reconstructs a previously unseen pathway in neural communication validated by a reputable neural lab (https:\/\/thedaily.case.edu\/discovering-a-new-form-of-communication-in-the-brain\/).\r\nUsing the software the PI was able to demonstrate that the electromagnetic field in neural tissue accesses quantum effects to perform hypercomputation (via analysis of recordings of resected rat cortical neuron slices under a pharmacologically induced sleep \/ wake model > synaptic pruning during slow wave sleep is known to be beyond what Turing computers can achieve).\r\nThis work led to a brief time at CERN, given from the known critiques against quantum effects persisting in the brain (e.g. Tegmark re temperature & time), with an aim towards reviewing what interpretation would need to hold, for the prior observations to be real.\r\nWithin hyper-computing efforts, when you evaluate where capital is allocated, controlled for the physics that needs to hold for those systems to work, you become alarmed that all the capital is only going to two of the three potential interpretations, which are proving to be difficult to scale (https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/6d2e34ab-f9fd-4041-8a96-91802bab7765).\r\nThe PI proposes developing a counterfactual hyper-computer, whose computation would only work in a universe where the third so-far unexplored interpretation would be real, namely paradox-free retrocausality.\r\nThe experimental test proposed is to see if computational supremacy can be demonstrated via bitcoin mining, given within computational complexity it's known the type of computer proposed would have unrivaled speedup.\r\nIf this device becomes real the larger opportunity is to help broad applications in scientific engineering by enabling systems of linear equations at a level of complexity & data scale beyond what is possible with today's GPU's to be solve-able.\r\nThe proposal involves a 2-3 year research project with 6 fte including the PI and includes a forecasted budget requirement of $5mm in US fiat.\r\nThe implication, if this project is successful, would mean that quantum mechanics would be an emergent property of space-time, not unlike how it's been shown recently that electromagnetism is (https:\/\/sciencex.com\/news\/2021-07-electromagnetism-property-spacetime.html), which itself suggests that what the PI proposes is physically possible and achievable to engineer at a human scale (and within reason to suspect that the electromagnetic field in brains manipulate space-time), where otherwise it was thought that large masses would be needed to effect gravity at a level required in order to manipulate space-time.\r\nRecently Sir Roger Penrose has been public regarding his view that retroactivity is what imbues the brain with its computational abilities (40:59 to 55:05:\u00a0https:\/\/youtu.be\/L_o-86wYDp8?t=2459) which is consistent with the suggestion that the electromagnetic field in brain's manipulate space-time.\r\nSir Roger Penrose has been public that whatever the secret to brain function is likely to be found in the ephaptic connections (3:43:48 to 3:48:00:\u00a0https:\/\/youtu.be\/L_o-86wYDp8?t=2459) which the referenced software reconstructed and was the source for the PI finding evidence for quantum effects persisting in the brain (suggesting the physical phenomenon sought in this experiment is the key to how brain's achieve hypercomputation).\r\nThe proposed physical phenomena was first predicted by G\u00f6del in some of his solutions to Einstein's equations, which has been discarded by the science community, although it is found in Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.\r\nThe proposed device would incorporate two parts that together would combine to elicit counterfactual computation:\r\noptical loop ring resonator using lasers & mirrors to elicit falaco soliton across time (2:05 to 2:10 in this video:\u00a0https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pnbJEg9r1o8).\r\nrecursive brute force algorithm (8min video:\u00a0https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zCnz4GxNd_M).\r\nHere is a presentation for the proposed project (with corresponding additional links):\u00a0https:\/\/www.beautiful.ai\/player\/-NB9TV4QniFKmUfuzyxR\r\nHere is a 60 min talk the PI gave in 2019 reviewing his research path to arrive at the proposal:\u00a0https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1kJ4Achi2DZmVa2hZsaYbraakeAP6ZGSP\/view\r\nIt must be noted that the general science community is likely to find this proposal laughable, however to our mind we argue that it is not absurd to investigate an equally absurd possibility (in regards to the foundational implications of a working hyper-computer).\r\nThe gitcoin opportunity has potential for high impact given it's unlikely for this project to receive funding otherwise given\u00a0systemic\u00a0issues with how capital is allocated in scientific research\r\nOn the scale of humanity, one would assume given the importance of moving beyond Turing, that we would leave no stone unturned.\r\nA commercial white paper can be found

The partnerships will be key to the WeSeed team's capacity to collect data that reflect the community's stared needs. These meaningful data will help build a robust, tokenized system around seed banking, gardening and community asset mapping. These assets include the\u00a0\r\nfood itself,\u00a0\r\ncritical relationships that give people access to food,\u00a0\r\ncritical infrastructure that give people access to food and\u00a0\r\nrights to decide their own access to food.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses two major concerns driving regenerative finance projects: biodiversity (in locally grown fruits and vegetables) and social justice (in community-driven solutions for food sovereignty).\r\n\r\nBy Phase III, WeSeed will have built a tokenized co-op to give people living in food apartheids in Raleigh consistent access to the nutritious foods they want. .\u00a0\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nPhase I of WeSeed lays the foundation for a system of growing, harvesting and purchasing locally grown foods for current and future generations.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand how local families and communities in Raleigh, North Carolina see their relationships to the supply of and demand for food.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLocal organizations, already doing food sovereignty work in the community will put WeSeed in touch with 5 families\/meal groups for fact-finding sessions to discover the facts of each family's access to healthy food. These fact-finding meetings will be actual meals with people who live with food Insecurity.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWeSeed will record these fact-finding sessions, transcribe the recordings and analyze the transcripts for themes about what people believe they need to meet their nutrition needs and what solutions people want for themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe findings from this phase will support the success of Phases II (strategically developed seed library of Indigenous fruits and vegetables).\r\n\r\nPhase III (strategically planted gardens, a co-op for harvested produce and a tokenized community asset map of these gardens).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe community asset map will be a technology application that hosts a layered Geographical Information Systems (GIS) map. Layers will show:\u00a0\r\nFood needs (food and logistics) identified by families\r\nFood solutions (food and logistics) identified by families\u00a0\r\nHarvest timelines of existing crops (community has access to) and crops planted through this program\r\nHarvest-to-market transportation\u00a0\r\nGrocers and other food vendors\u00a0\r\nSchools (science classes) - Data will be made available for science projects\r\nParticipating places of worship\u00a0\r\nParticipating colleges and universities\u00a0\r\nAgricultural extensions\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Introduce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoothDiscovery is a platform for discovering fair,transparent and decentralized token price. It enables everyone to find reasonable token prices and start Batch Auctions to sell ECR-20 tokens effectively and efficiently on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nBatch auctions are a fair pricing method that has been battle tested in traditional finance. Some of its uses include everyday Open auction in the NYSE, Direct listings, as well as in IPOs.\r\n\r\nHow Batch Auctions Work:\r\n\r\n1.In batch auctions, the participants are one auctioneer and multiple bidders.\r\n2.The auctioneer determines the auction's sell price and limit price. The sell price is the amount of tokens the auctioneer would like to sell and the limit price is the minimum price they are willing to receive for the asset.\r\n3.Once the auction starts, bidders can participate by placing their bids through limit orders, specifying an amount and a limit price.\r\n4.The auction runs until a certain date.The auction ends after the closing date. No more bids can be placed afterwards.\r\n5.At the auction clearing, the auction settles the final clearing price which is the price where the supply line and demand curve intersect.\r\n6.The clearing-price will be the final clearing price for all participants.\r\n7.The auctioned tokens will be sold at the clearing price to bidders who specified a maximum price in their limit order which is greater than the final clearing price.\r\n8.Bidders who specified a maximum price in their limit order that is less than the final clearing price do not receive the auctioned tokens. But for sure, they can still withdraw their bidding tokens from the auction.\r\n\r\nAnyone can utilizee SmoothDiscovery to conduct a token auction subject. SmoothDiscovery or any affiliated entity has no involvement with the auctioneer(s) or the auctions, which are independently organized by the auctioneer(s). SmoothDiscovery is only involved in developing the smart contracts that make the dapp run.",

Currently, the Views section is divided into 9 sections, namely Creator, NFT, Hiring, Meme, etc. We hope that each user can discover quality content in different types of content sections and pitch to target people. Later, we will put online the user points function in the Views section and add the incentive system so that users can Share-To-Earn.\r\n\r\nThe \"Service\" section mainly provides various services and tools for projects, organizations and DAOs, etc. The product function currently online is the AMA section. ViewsDAO provides AMA-related functions and tools, including project introduction interface, AMA interface (for moderators and guests only), discussion interface for user discussions, and Question List interface for AMA questions. At present, the AMA function is not yet open.

The initial idea is to build a more reliable comment widget with Arweave, which helps us to make data reliable, decentralized, persistent and censorship-resistant.\r\nDuring this year, we witness the rapid growing of Arweave. Arweave\u2019s vision is to store documents and applications permanently, and ECHO is here to preserve our opinion on anything in the world.\r\n\r\nAbout \u201cECHO\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we comment on a thing, we call it an echo; when someone make a response to the comment, maybe a thumb-up, it is also an echo. \r\nIn Shell and PHP, echo is also used as a command to output the strings that are passed to it as arguments. \r\nThe word \u201cecho\u201d presents voice, and also response. We want ECHO to record them all.\r\n\r\nOur Slogan\r\n\r\nIndividual\u2019s views are ignored in recorded history. However, History should not be just about the thing but also the thought. Our opinion is a part of things. Saving our views, emotions, likes and dislikes permanently equals capturing the moment forever. \r\nWith internet and blockchain, it is possible for experience and thoughts of our current era to reach far into future. That is, time fades, but views live on.\r\nThat\u2019s why our slogan is Long live our opinion.\r\n\r\nWe Need Better Tooling\r\n\r\nThe following comment widgets are popular.\r\nDisqus\r\nhttps:\/\/giscus.app\/ (Github discussion)\r\ntwikoo.js (Self hosted)\r\nhttps:\/\/utteranc.es\/ (GitHub issue)\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/gitalk\/gitalk (GitHub issue)\r\n\r\nThere are some obvious problems with these tools.\r\nThe data does not belong to the person who made the comment or obtained it.\r\nAccounts in centralized services, like GitHub, may be banned due to geopolitics.\r\nSelf-hosting on a server has cost and technology barriers.\r\n\r\nECHO is designed to solve these issues.\r\nEach comment will be uploaded with signature of user.\r\nWallet and data can\u2019t be deleted or modified.\r\nIt is an out-of-the-box solution.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nDecentralization\r\n\r\nDecentralization consists of three aspects: decentralized authorization, decentralized data and decentralized front-ends.\r\nUsers sign into ECHO with a decentralized wallet. It means you can sign and upload data to Arweave with and without using a front-end page. The related SDK will be released as open source later.\r\nArweave is a decentralized solution for archiving data. We will provide multiple official gateways and open source our codebase. We also encourage the community to set up your own gateways. Any gateway will synchronize valid data uploaded by other gateways.\r\nOur front-end code has been deployed to ipfs. You can use any ipns gateway to visit our widget.\r\nBesides web3 products, we encourage non-web3 or non-dweb products to use our widget.\r\n\r\nOpinion Aggregation\r\n\r\nECHO uses target_uri to identify the comment target. We have designed a set of url schema to identify different objects. Users may comment on the same object, such as a NFT, on different websites and apps, but as long as the target_uri is the same, the corresponding comments will all be displayed.\r\nThe followings are some examples of schema.\r\n\r\ndweb\/ipfs\/{cid} \/\/ ipfs page\r\ndweb\/ipns\/{path} \/\/ ipns page\r\ndatabase\/imdb\/{imdb} \/\/  movie\r\ndatabase\/isbn\/{isbn} \/\/ book\r\nhttps:\/\/{path} \/\/ http url\r\n\r\nMulti-chain Login and Tip\r\n\r\nECHO supports MetaMask (EVM chains) and Phantom (Solana). If you log in with MetaMask, we will retrieve and display reverse record and avatar of your ens or .bit.\r\nThe comment target of the following widget is https:\/\/0xecho.com.\r\n\r\nFee\r\nThe price to store data on Arweave is less than $2.5\/1G at this point (2022-09-01), which is cheaper compared to annual fee of Amazon S3 in the long run. The data in ECHO is lightweight text-based. We use Arseeding to upload data to Arweave regularly.\r\nEach user gets 200 uploads per day for free. If there are changes we will inform you. These free uploads are able to cover most people\u2019s daily use. You will feel at ease just like using Web2 apps, when you make comments or thumb-ups via ECHO.\r\nAlso, to avoid abuse, a wallet with non-zero balance is required.\r\n\r\nOut-of-the-box Solution\r\n\r\nThe iframe embed widget is easy and hassle-free to get in our website. \r\nModules are configurable.\r\nTheme color is configurable.\r\nDID to receive donations is configurable.

		"description": "\u3010Problems we target\u3011\r\n\r\nENS is now widely recognized as having won the race for being the Web3 identity standard. However, compared with some other Web3 IDs, ENS might still be too difficult for most users who are just starting to understand blockchain and Ethereum transactions. These users are interested in having their ENS name but it will be the first time they actually make a transaction on Ethereum chain. It is likely that their prior exposure to Ethereum is limited \u201cinvesting\u201d in ETH via a Centralised Exchange.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe current ENS registration system has some prerequisite that some users will find difficult.\u00a0They are\r\n(1) Difficulties in acquiring an Ethereum:\u00a0\r\nUnder certain circumstances there are no ways to get Ether easily. For example in some countries, ETH is hard to purchase with fiat. Some centralised exchanges also take some time to send out ETH to new wallet address as part of a security limitation. Therefore, some users don't even have the ether token required to register an ENS name.\r\n(2)\u00a0Difficulties in having a wallet\uff1a\r\nFor a lot of new comers, they even haven\u2019t had their wallet yet, which is a must to hold their ENS names. Also they are not familiar with the usage of the wallet as well as the process of having a wallet. Therefore, this situation becomes a huge entry barrier for users to register an ENS name. There is also a large learning curve to keep your wallet secure.\u00a0\r\n(3)\u00a0Difficulties in understanding the registration process:\r\nCurrent ENS registration process is not familiar to users who are used to most online apps. Most users are more familiar with a Godaddy or shopping cart process for web2 domains and do not understand why there is a two step process or gas fees or wallets involved. For these users, gas fees are also perplexing as they do not understand why the cost can be different each time.\r\n(4)\u00a0Difficulties in finding the desired available names:\u00a0\r\nCurrent registration platform only supports users to search names one by one. Also a lot of names are already registered now by squatters. Therefore it is very inconvenient and time consuming for new users to find an available name that fits their demand.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u3010Our solution\u3011\r\n\r\nWe want to solve the above pain points and help more users to have their desired ENS names without hassle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur service helps users to\u00a0buy their ENS domains in 24 hours at a fixed price in USD. We assume the users are familiar with domain or online purchases but this is their first blockchain purchase.\r\nBuy.ensdom.com allows customers to use a familiar process to find, choose and register\u00a0their chosen ENS names.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThrough our website, users can choose the ENS name they want to register, check out through their own credit card\/PayPal and wait for our confirmation email after we\u2019ve actually sent your name on your wallet or in our custody wallet.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope that this will onboard more users into exploring more with Ethereum chain and other dApps.\r\n\r\n\u3010Our value for ENS Ecosystem\u3011\r\n\r\nWe focus on accomplishing the followings for ENS : \r\n(1) Usability - improving the user experience\r\nOur website comes in very handy for the users because they can purchase their desired .eth names without having to worry about the gas fees nor having a wallet. There is nothing more convenient than actually buying your .eth name in just a few taps using only your credit card. Even people who lack understanding and knowledge about the requirements of purchasing their own ENS name can easily have their own .eth names by using our site.\u00a0\r\n\r\n(2)Community - growing the ecosystem\r\nBy lowering the threshold of users\u2019 having their ENS name, we can let more newcomers join the ENS community, thus growing the whole ecosystem and boosting the community and interest in ENS. It is likely ENS will be their first experience with the blockchain and we hope to welcome them via an easy to understand process.\r\n\r\n\u3010Future Development Plan\u3011\r\n\r\nWith the grant, we can build a better website with a powerful search function to help users find and register available names more easily.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ideal plan is that after users enter and search the name they are interested in, we will provide them with a list of names that looks similar to their searched item and meanwhile show their availability status. After the search, users can directly click into the available name and register the name immediately through our service.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThus, people will neither have to worry about having ETH nor the troublesome ENS registration process and bulk research.",

		"description": "THING is a DApp for running and scaling democratic operations of groups. By providing tools to organise and hold transparent, fair and legitimate votes, THING seeks to expand, reinforce and protect democratic organisations and civil society on the planet. \r\n\r\nUsers can create organizations in a web app and other users can register for these organizations. Members of organizations can create or participate in internal voting. They can create profiles, connect, form groups or write posts.\r\nThis privacy focused, easy to use app is made for non-technical users. All members have the same access to its functions and elections are auditable.\r\n\r\nLightpaper (PDF)\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Problem \r\nTraditional NGOs, clubs, local initiatives, political parties and other democratic organisations, suffer from slow scaling, asymmetric information distribution and manipulable voting. These challenges put at risk their functioning, the participation of their members and their impacts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slow scaling: it takes an immense amount of resources and time to scale from a new political group into an influential political party (or any other organisation).\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asymmetric information distribution: very often, organisations still run themselves like 100 years ago with mandatory on site events and voting. Pyramid-like structures emerge, with local groups moving up through delegates in higher groups to a few decision-makers at the top. Information (e.g. majority opinions, discussions) remains in the groups and is not distributed equally throughout the\u00a0organization. Organization-wide consensus initiated from the bottom up may be difficult or impossible to achieve.\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Manipulable voting: the higher someone is in the structure, the easier it is for that person to control the pivotal players below them by using\u00a0her \/ his\u00a0power and resources.\u00a0People in power\u00a0can also control rules and format for communication and voting (e.g. how, when and where voting or an event takes place). Thereby they can influence election results or conversations in their favour.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe solution\r\nTHING addresses these issues by providing the following features:\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0Fast, simple & privacy focused authentication and decentralised ID (to address problem 1)\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0User friendliness and simple pre-set voting options (blockchain tech hidden) equally accessible to all members (to address problem 1)\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0Profiles, posts, comments, groups (to address problems 1 and 2)\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0Standardised, anonymous & auditable voting (to address problems 2 and 3)\r\n\u00a0\r\nMore specifically, this React web app with blockchain backend will offer:\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0Authentication functions e.g. with tel. no. (possible technology: DID w\/ KILT \/ Litentry)\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0Social media functions (possible technology: subsocial \/ DSNP)\r\n\u00a7\u00a0\u00a0Voting functions (possible technology: data on IPFS \/ arweave & contracts on Phala \/ Astar \/ Moonbeam)\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe innovation\r\nOur research shows that no similar solution is currently available on the market. While different features are available separately, no solution provides them all together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe market\r\nTHING is being developed for groups such as new and existing political movements, political campaigns (e.g. running for a seat in congress) and civil society organisations of all sizes. We estimate that in geographical Europe only, there are 7.5 M potential political activists \/ organisers starting a group. We estimate that 750 K existing groups (clubs, associations, \u2026) could use THING. We assume these groups to have roughly 75 M members in total. We need to validate these estimates through a detailed market analysis.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe roadmap\r\nThe concept is now finalised. We are working on a light paper and user research to deliver a prototype by the end of November. THING will then be fine tuned for different types of organisations in the EU and outside.\r\nOnce up and running, THING will be managed by an independent foundation running as a DAO.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWho we are\r\nWe are a bunch of web3 enthusiasts from different backgrounds with a genuine interest to support civil society and democratic processes. We are now in the incubation program \u201cPolkadot Relayers 2022\u201d and we are seeking support and funds to build a prototype. The grant will help us continue our work and hire technical experts and developers.\r\nDaniel Rodr\u00edguez \r\nThomas Magerl\r\nWilliam Mejia\r\nAndr\u00e9a Vistoli \r\n\u00a0\r\nWhy Thing\r\nThings were governing assemblies in early northern Europe. \r\nRead more on Wikipedia.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Contributing this cause will help the underprivileged children have access to free education. As children are still longer out of school, we are witnessing a greater risk that the poorest among them have never returned to school. It has come with intended consequences as so many children are still at home roaming the streets even after school re-opening. We are experiencing increased cases of violence, child labour, child marriage, and mental well-being. Funding for this project will also help us to build classroom and sanitary facilities in various rural communities in Enugu State who have dilapidated classroom blocks. This project will be implemented in partnership with our local nonprofit organizations working in children's education. \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge:\r\n\r\nMost of the women and young girls living in Enugu State lack basic skills and education for income generation. Their dependency on handouts from men through transactional sex makes them vulnerable to social abuse, sexual exploitation, unwanted pregnancies, HIV\/AIDS infection and domestic violence as they attempt to get their basic needs. This makes their children vulnerable. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nWhen the school closed in March 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we expected that every child will return back to school but it never happened. 18.5 million, 10.5 million are girls in Nigeria who never returned to school. We need them back to school to learn with others. There are increased cases of violence and child labour as they continue to roam the streets. Together, let us vulnerable children get back their happy lives by helping them access education as well as reduce child violence and labour.\\nSelf-sustained children will be an asset to their families and the community. Children being back to school will enhance their career dreams and propel them to take up community and national leadership roles as others. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have achieved as an organization:\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 2016, Helpers Social Development Foundation has been working to implement problems that may prevent children from gaining access to education. We have impacted over 3700 lives through the support of our donors and volunteers. We have built sanitary facilities and distributed free school supplies in public schools to ensure underprivileged children stay in school. October 20221, we established a nursery and primary school in Oji-River due to the growing number of out-of-school children in Nigeria. Our school Helpers Foundation nursery and primary school Oji-river offer 100% free education to out-of-school children. \\n\\nSupporting our mission will help us to build classroom blocks and distribute free school supplies in public schools to ensure underprivileged children stay in school. \r\n\r\n100% of your donations to our organization go to charity. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy You should support us? \r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution to our vision for a better society. The implementation of this project will start on 15th October 2022. \r\n\r\nFollow our Twitter handle: Twitter to see what we achieved with your support. \r\n\r\nHelp us to write inspiring stories on how crypto web3 can alleviate poverty in Africa. Use our organization as a case study on how we established a free school for underprivileged children through crypto donations. \r\n\r\nContinues supporting our organization's mission will help us to reach more children who do not have hope to survive. Funding this project underprivileged in Enugu State has access to education. \r\n\r\nHelpers Social Development Foundation is one of the leading nonprofit organization's in Africa impacting lives through cryptocurrency donations. Consider donating crypto to us to alleviate poverty in our community. \r\n\r\nHelp to fund Helpers Foundation project programs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "AbjaDAO | The DAO Translating Blockchain to Arabic\r\n\r\nHow to translate the word \u2018Blockchain\u2019 to Arabic? 13 years after Bitcoin was launched, somehow this question remains unanswered.\r\n\r\nSome translators choose to Arabize the term, or type it with Arabic alphabets, so it sounds the same and maintains its global familiarity. But due to Arabic\u2019s phonetic complexity, the word Blockchain can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: (\u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062a\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062a\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646). Other translators tried to translate the word by searching for an Arabic equivalent. The most common translation today is (\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0644), which translates back to English as \u2018A Chain of Blocks\u2019, more of an explanation than a translation.\r\n\r\nBut why is translating to Arabic this tricky? One way to approach this question is by comparing Arabic to Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken to one extent or another across all of Europe, and the different European peoples started producing their local iterations from Latin, which developed with time to constitute new branched languages.\r\n\r\nWhile Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, political and cultural reasons dictated that Arabic shall remain one language with multiple dialects, and that these dialects shall not grow into new different languages. Today, one can argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less intelligible than Italian and Spanish, however Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects of the same language, while Italian and Spanish are considered to be two languages.\r\n\r\nThis is one major source of headache when it comes to translating to Arabic. We need to find a translation that works with people of different linguistic practices, a task that feels like coming up with a \u2018European\u2019 translation of the word Blockchain, one that works across the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has been causing a myriad of issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other hand, without a standardized way to spell or translate essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers will be significantly compromised.\r\n\r\nThe cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process, which was the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact, and unintentionally, amplify the problem by introducing translation dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and translation biases, such as regional bias, where a translation is better understood in one part of the Arab region over the rest.\r\n\r\nTranslation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, such as lack of proper blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, which allows for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses. That\u2019s why it\u2019s no wonder that MENA (Middle East & North Africa), a region that houses over 570M residents, remains one of the slowest regions in terms of blockchain and crypto currencies adoption in the world.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this is why AbjaDAO exists!\r\n\r\nAbjaDAO is a guild-type special purpose DAO, it\u2019s named after the Arabic alphabet, which is usually abbreviated as ABJAD (similar to ABC). AbjaDAO brings together four MENA-based blockchain-focused initiatives, around a plan to develop a decentralized and unified Arabic blockchain glossary.\r\n\r\nOur DAO includes representatives from ZeFi, a 40-people strong research and media project specialized in Arabic blockchain content. ZeFi were working on their own expansive dictionary when AbjaDAO came together, and they shared with us hundreds of translated and explained terms to use as a cornerstone. The DAO also includes Arabs in Blockchain initiative, founded by Eman Herawy, an Ethereum fellow who played a leading role in translating Ethereum to Arabic. Tafkir, a research and public goods center that conceived AbjaDAO, bringing to the table experienced academic and literary translators. And DocStream, a collective of editorial and translation service providers that serve the British Council amongst other clients.\r\n\r\nTogether, and joined by individual experts and consultants, we conceived a plan to develop a unifying glossary for Arabic blockchain terminology. We began by surveying a large body of blockchain literature to extract a list of nearly 1,400 terms, words and abbreviations. We are currently working on sorting these terms by frequency of use, and grouping them into thematic patches. In parallel, we are conducting a series of workshops to settle on translation philosophy and approaches. If you are an Arabic reader, you can track our progress on both tracks here (Listing and Patching Table, Translation Philosophy).\r\n\r\nIn the next phase of the project, we will conduct 4-hour workshops bringing together 7 translation experts from within and outside the DAO. Those translators will tackle a thematic patch of terms in every workshop, submit their different translations, and settle on the best translation through discussion or voting.\r\n\r\nBut translation is only half the answer. The other half would be propagation. For our translations to get picked up and start replacing former dispersed translations, we plan to follow the release of the glossary with a propagation campaign, aiming at having the glossary adopted by: 5 Arab colleges, 2 mainstream and 10 alternative pan-Arab media outlets, 25 blockchain-focused social media pages and influencers and 5 Arabic UI \/ UX websites or apps. We also plan to set up a Wikipedia grant, motivating translators to bring 20 essential blockchain pages to Arabic, using our glossary through translation.\r\n\r\nThe glossary will be a public good, and accessible to all for free. We hope to publish the first version of the glossary with 600-1000 terms translated, sometime before the end of the year (for a more detailed timeline, check our presentation!). After the initial release, we plan to update the glossary on 6-9 months intervals.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have received funding from the Solana Foundation through Tafkir, we also received logistical support from the Ethereum Foundation, who are sharing with us their own glossary to use as a point of reference. But we need further funding to see this project through. To support our DAO or learn more on our progress, you can download this presentation.\r\n",

		"description": "How do we translate \u2018Blockchain\u2019 to Arabic? Thirteen years after Bitcoin was launched, somehow this question remains unanswered.\r\n\r\nSome translators choose to transliterate the term, using Arabic script while preserving the sound and maintaining its global familiarity. Given the lack of uniform phonetic alphabet, however, the Arabized word can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062a\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062a\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646. Other translators opt for an Arabic equivalent through literal translation. The most common translation today is \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0644, which translates back to \u2018The Chain of Blocks\u2019, more of an explanation than a translation.\r\n\r\nBut why is translating to Arabic so tricky? Compare it with Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken more or less across most of southern Europe, with the different Latin-speaking nations developing their own Latin vernaculars, which later evolved into brand new languages.\r\n\r\nWhile Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, a combination of cultural and geopolitical factors made Arabic one language with multiple dialects unable to grow into new distinct languages. One could argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less mutually intelligible than Italian and Spanish, yet Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects, especially given the shared literary space, while Italian and Spanish are two separate national languages.\r\n\r\nThis is one source of the headache felt by Arabic technology translators. They have to navigate different linguistic practices to arrive at terms working for all. This feels like coming up with a \u2018European\u2019 translation of the word Blockchain that works across the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has caused innumerable issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other, without a standardized spelling or translation of essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers are significantly compromised.\r\n\r\nThe cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process. This has been the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact unintentionally amplify the problem by introducing more dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and where uneven localizations, e.g. regional biases, mean that some translations are better understood in one part of the Arab region but not the others.\r\n\r\nTranslation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, including lack of blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, allowing for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses. That\u2019s why it\u2019s no wonder that MENA (Middle East & North Africa), a region that houses over 570M residents, remains one of the slowest regions to adopt blockchain and crypto currencies in the world.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this is why AbjaDAO exists!\r\n\r\nAbjaDAO is a guild-type special purpose DAO named after the original order of the semitic alphabet - ABJAD is one way of saying \u2018A-B-C-D-E\u2019 in Arabic. AbjaDAO brings together four MENA-based blockchain-focused initiatives, with a view to developing a decentralized and unified Arabic blockchain glossary.\r\n\r\nOur DAO includes representatives from ZeFi, a 40-people strong research and media project specialized in Arabic blockchain content. ZeFi were working on their own expansive dictionary when AbjaDAO came together, with their hundreds of translated and explained terms becoming AbjaDAO\u2019s cornerstone. The DAO also includes Arabs in Blockchain initiative, founded by Eman Herawy, an Ethereum fellow who played a leading role in translating Ethereum to Arabic. Tafkir, a research and public goods center that conceived AbjaDAO, brings to the table experienced academic and literary translators, along with DocStream, a collective of linguists specialized in the social sciences and the humanities.\r\n\r\nTogether, and joined by individual experts and consultants, we put together a plan to develop a unified glossary for Arabic blockchain terminology. We began by surveying a large body of blockchain literature to extract a list of nearly 1,400 terms, phrases and abbreviations. We are currently working on sorting these terms by frequency of use, and grouping them into thematic patches. In parallel, we are conducting a series of workshops to settle on translation philosophy and approaches. \r\n\r\nIn the next phase of the project, we will conduct 4-hour workshops bringing together 7 translation experts from within and outside the DAO. Those translators will tackle a thematic patch of terms in every workshop, submit their different translations, and settle on the best terminological choices through discussion or voting.\r\n\r\nTranslation, however, is only half the answer. The other would be propagation. For our translations to get picked up and start replacing former scattered terms, we plan to follow the release of the glossary with a propagation campaign, aiming at having the glossary adopted by: 5 Arab colleges, 2 mainstream and 10 alternative pan-Arab media outlets, 25 blockchain-focused social media pages and influencers and 5 Arabic UI \/ UX websites or apps.

But due to Arabic\u2019s phonetic complexity, the word Blockchain can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: (\u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062a\u0634\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062a\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0646).

One way to approach this question is by comparing Arabic to Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken to one extent or another across all of Europe, and the different European peoples started producing their local iterations from Latin, which developed with time to constitute new branched languages.\r\n\r\nWhile Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, political and cultural reasons dictated that Arabic shall remain one language with multiple dialects, and that these dialects shall not grow into new different languages. Today, one can argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less intelligible than Italian and Spanish, however Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects of the same language, while Italian and Spanish are considered to be two languages.\r\n\r\nThis is one major source of headache when it comes to translating to Arabic. We need to find a translation that works with people of different linguistic practices, a task that feels like coming up with a \u2018European\u2019 translation of the word Blockchain, one that works across the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has been causing a myriad of issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other hand, without a standardized way to spell or translate essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers will be significantly compromised.\r\n\r\nThe cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process, which was the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact, and unintentionally, amplify the problem by introducing translation dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and translation biases, such as regional bias, where a translation is better understood in one part of the Arab region over the rest.\r\n\r\nTranslation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, such as lack of proper blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, which allows for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses.

		"description": "Orbit is a necessary layer to scale LPing, facilitating execution and automation of strategies for liquidity providers and aiming to make DeFi simpler and widely available to anybody.\r\n\r\nToo many Uniswap V3 Liquidity Providers lose money. Approximately 40-45 percent of the positions are out of range, resulting in no fee generation. Moreover, Uniswap still lacks the capabilities necessary to rebalance or restructure positions for many possible usages.\r\nThese are critical factors to consider, but LPs frequently forget about them, incurring in more risks.\r\n\r\nWe feel that the ecosystem lacks the tools necessary to properly analyze and address these challenges, making concentrated liquidity a complex activity that does not fully realize and express its potential.\r\n\r\nOrbit enables to quickly deploy, automate, combine and monitor structured strategies with total flexibility, abstracting away any operational complexity for any token pair and ranges.\r\n\r\nIt is an automation layer that allows users to easily define and execute liquidity operations across several protocols.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to become the go-to platform for concentrated liquidity, giving users the possibility to deploy and automate complex strategies for managing liquidity, both in and out of range, with the aim of solving all the aforementioned problems.\r\n\r\nOrbit works with a Smart Vault model: users own a smart contract that is used as an account to handle tokens, that can then be connected to other protocols to allow for automatic allocations.\r\n\r\nIt is centered around three main features:\r\nAutocompound: this feature allows the user to automatically swap and reinvest fees sitting idle in the Uni v3 position, maximizing the APY on the idle fraction of the different users\u2019 positions;\r\nAutorebalance: this feature allows the user to put an out-of-range position back into the range so that it is possible to never stop earning fees;\r\nIdle Liquidity: this feature allows users to boost yields by exploiting idle liquidity in other protocols (such as Aave).\r\n\r\nThese first features can be used on an unlimited number of positions and token pairs at once.\r\n\r\nWith this Grant we will accelerate development and integration with more and more protocols, in order to give further flexibility to users and enable them to create delta-neutral strategies and hedge against Impermanent Loss.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this project, initially named \u201cUniStrategy\", has been Finalist at ETHGlobal UniCode 2021.",

This question lies at the core of governance. Within the DAO space, and in democracies at large, this question is usually addressed with voting \u2013 quadratically weighted or not.\r\n\r\nHowever, in our extremely technical world, our ability to exercise good judgment about a specific topic vastly differs between us.\r\n\r\nReputation can be thought of as the collective judgment about a certain person or organization\u2019s ability or trustworthiness on a certain topic within a certain context. Thus, reputation systems could aid legitimation processes by offering a supplement to voting-based mechanisms. Indeed, the legitimation process underpinning peer-review is to a large extent reputation-based. Papers with lots of citations become reputable, and that paper\u2019s successive citings are thus granted further legitimacy. One could imagine what the world of science would look like if the legitimacy of papers was entirely the subject of a permissionless vote.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current paradigm of online reputation systems are almost exclusively built on scalars. This is problematic, as much is lost when our multifaceted skills, abilities and relationships are collapsed into uni-dimensional social credit scores.\r\n\r\nMulti-dimensional reputation systems offer an alternative. With language models, we have the ability to create such systems from textual interactions that capture the nuance list in scalars, and thus help us determine trustworthiness and legitimacy contextually within a social group.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\u00a0\r\nReplabs is building tools for DAOs and communities on Twitter that can be used to determine contextual reputation.\r\n\u00a0\r\nReplabs is also doing qualitative research on how well these tools and algorithms match the subjective experiences of the participants within the communities. These qualitative findings will be summarized in a technical paper.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat?\r\n\u00a0\r\nMore information about how the grant money will be used can be found here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "We believe that preserving culture is vital to humanity. Non-Fungible Castle (NFC) 2021 was a community building event hosted at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague Castle that bridged the traditional art world with the Web3 community to see how they can enhance, engage, and challenge one another. The event included an international conference exploring how blockchain technology can be incorporated into cultural heritage practices and a free temporary NFT exhibition hosted in one of the most visited cultural landmarks in the Czech Republic featuring original NFTs created by House of Lobkowicz as well as by contemporary artists. The exhibition demonstrated how technology can be used not only to enhance the viewer\u2019s experience with art, but also to see elements that are not visible in the real world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe success of NFC, which was also featured on the Unchained Podcast, demonstrates a use case for cultural institutions to increase accessibility, deepen relationships with a broader community of patrons and creators, and establish a creative platform to raise restoration funds. The exhibition received hundreds of visitors daily and the event welcomed over 200 attendees from all over the world. To that end, NFC returns for its second edition.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Fungible Castle (NFC) 2022\u00a0\r\nThis year\u2019s event explores how blockchain technology can be used to rediscover, share, and preserve cultural identity. Along with the NFT exhibition and international conference, a large component of this year's NFC will include an interactive cultural program inviting participants to immerse themselves in culture and history while exploring new applications of blockchain technology in the real world. We wish to enrich this experience with additional funding that will allow us to apply different tools that increase accessibility of NFTs and Web3 (for example creating wallets for event attendees), while continuing to pioneer, demonstrate, and educate audiences about the many use cases of blockchain technology.\u00a0\r\n\r\nConference\r\nThe conference will offer a dynamic forum convening thought leaders and tastemakers to discuss how the art and crypto worlds can engage with one another to shape the future of blockchain technology and cultural preservation. Leading experts in Web3 and the art world will explore a variety of topics and questions, including investing and building in the Web3 space, curation and sales in the Metaverse, and legal and regulatory implications. Our goal is to facilitate a broader conversation around blockchain technology and its applications in the art and philanthropic worlds.\r\n\r\nExhibition\r\nThe exhibition is inspired by the remarkable story of world-renowned Czech composer, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, who demonstrated an exceptional ability to distill the identity of a culture to a singular work of art. Using Dvo\u0159\u00e1k as a guiding force to create, international artists are invited to meditate on their personal cultural identities through different forms of artistic expression. The aim is not only to educate audiences about the significance of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, but also celebrate the cultural stories that define who we are and connect us to one another. The exhibition will also display original NFTs created by House of Lobkowicz.\u00a0\r\n\r\nInteractive Cultural Experience\r\nThe interactive cultural experience will offer a dynamic program inviting visitors back in time to Nelahozeves, the birthplace of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. There, they will be immersed in Czech traditions, engage with the sights and sounds that inspired Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s influential body of work, and reconnect to their cultural roots\u2014all through real world experiences enhanced by blockchain technology.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nOur goal is to facilitate a broader conversation around blockchain technology and its applications in the art and philanthropic worlds. By bringing together experts and visionaries from all sectors, we aim to build a growing community of people who value cultural preservation and the innovative possibilities of blockchain technology to make a positive impact in the world. We hope our efforts will help people see the value of blockchain technology beyond JPEGs, asset ownership, or serving as a basis for speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe team behind Non-Fungible Castle is House of Lobkowicz, a cultural organization that manages events, heritage sites, and the Lobkowicz Collections\u2014one of Europe\u2019s oldest and finest private collections, comprised of items dating back over 2,000 years.",

		"description": "Yaqu Pacha Uruguay is a civil non-profit organization dedicated to implement and promote projects for the protection, conservation and study of aquatic mammals in Uruguay and South Western Atlantic ocean.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne of the main projects is the Toninas Project) carried out since 2002, regarding the research and conservation of the recently recognized subspecies Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus gephyreus (known as \u201cTonina\u201d in Uruguay), \u00a0along the Uruguayan oceanic coast, an endangered species of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. This project addresses population ecology, social and acoustic behavior, habitat use and movements of Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphins along Uruguayan oceanic coast.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince 2018, Yaqu Pacha Uruguay has collaborated with Brazilian researchers in the Gephyreus Project. The goal of this project is estimating the total abundance of Lahille's bottlenose dolphin in southern Brazil and Uruguay and assessing its risk of extinction (founded by Yaqu Pacha Alemania, total granted 2021 for Uruguayan counterpart $5000).\r\n\r\nOur last project (2021-2022), funded by Eccosur (https:\/\/eccosur.org\/, grant received: $10.000 USD) was \u201cLahille's bottlenose dolphin the coastal sentinel: tourism, environmental education and integrated management\u201d. This project involved a vulnerability analysis of climate change effects on Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin, as well as a promotion of the species as a sentinel and flag species of the Uruguayan oceanic coast. We engaged educators and schoolchildren in various areas of the country, mainly on the coast, tourist operators and other local actors in environmental education activities to increase their awareness of the problems faced by the coastal system due to the effects of climate change and in particular, to see their effects on the Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn Uruguay, the Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin population is small (approximately 70 individuals), has a restricted distribution and is extremely coastal. It also has a high residence of photo-identified individuals, and high mobility tiwaters of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary and southern Brazilian waters, where there is a high mortality in artisanal fishing nets. In addition, this population belongs to the same management unit and evolutionary unit with the dolphins from southern Brazil, showing low genetic diversity. Due to all of the above, the dolphin was included in the list of priority species for the conservation of the National System of Protected Areas of Uruguay. The results of the investigations also contributed to the recognition of this dolphin as a subspecies and for its evaluation by the IUCN in the Vulnerable category. Although very little information exists on possible direct and indirect threats to the subspecies in Uruguayan waters, contamination from agricultural effluents could be a source of concern due to the pollutant load detected in other marine organisms in areas of high occurrence of Lahille\u2019s Bottlenose Dolphins. Reduced prey availability caused by overfishing and destruction of benthic ecosystems due to fisheries are other possible threats for the subspecies in Uruguay. Incidental capture of Lahille\u2019s Bottlenose Dolphins in fishing gear in Uruguay is rare. However, in the last 2 years at least five animals were recorded\u00a0 stranded, two of them with bycatch signs from fishing nets located 300m from the coast (\u201csubsistence fishery\u201d).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main priorities are:\r\n\r\nTo resume systematic boat surveys between La Paloma and Punta del Diablo (principally Esmeralda-south to Cabo Polonio) for photo-id and acoustic records. Catalogue update. Population monitoring\r\nTo make a new abundance estimate on the Uruguayan coast as well as other population parameters (survival, births interval, movement patterns, residency).\u00a0\r\nTo get in depth about effects of Climate Change in dolphin\u2019s occurrence and distribution.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nTo test hypotheses regarding occurrence of dolphins and coastal upwellings.\r\nTo continue coordinated efforts with Brazil, focusing into whistle analysis, specially of signature whistles and catalog construction, social structure analysis and individual movement analyses.\r\nTo start studies regarding contaminants levels in tissues of dolphins.\r\nTo biopsy samples for genetic, social structure and forging ecology studies.\r\nTo include anthropological perspective for historical data of occurrence of Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin in Rio de la Plata Estuary.\r\nTo monitor mortality (Stranding network)\r\nTo promote citizen science: records of dolphins by citizens\u00a0 all along the Uruguayan coast (https:\/\/www.arcgis.com\/apps\/dashboards\/f4521a13d27045909d4d994d82a872c8).\r\n\r\nTo keep visiting local schools in order to engage schoolchildren in environmental education activities.\r\nTo keep raising awareness of the effects of climate change on the Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin population and the importance of conservation of the coastal marine ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits to the DeSci community\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As one of the first Latin American projects in DeSci, we will contribute to enhancing awareness of the DeSci movement across these latitudes, which will promote its expansion and increase its diversity.\r\n\r\n2. We will also contribute to opening DeSci to other different disciplines rather than biotech\/biopharma.\u00a0 Opening DeSci to conservation biology projects will also promote DeSci diversity and the inclusion of more descientists and different perspectives.\r\n\r\n3. We will demonstrate the efficiency of quadratic funding as an alternative way of funding often underfunded projects such as those of non-profit, independent, research groups working on conservation biology and focusing on climate change effects on biodiversity.\r\n\r\n4. We will explore blockchain technology to build up shared databases of photo-id and whistles catalogs between other research groups working on cetacean populations.",

		"description": "Project Toninas: Lahille's bottlenose dolphin as a coastal sentinel\r\n\r\nYaqu Pacha Uruguay is a civil non-profit organization dedicated to implementing and promoting projects for the protection, conservation, and study of aquatic mammals in Uruguay and the South Western Atlantic ocean.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne of the main projects is the Toninas Project) carried out since 2002, regarding the research and conservation of the recently recognized subspecies Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus gephyreus (known as \u201cTonina\u201d in Uruguay),\u00a0along the Uruguayan oceanic coast, an endangered species of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. This project addresses population ecology, social and acoustic behavior, habitat use, and movements of Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphins along the Uruguayan oceanic coast.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince 2018, Yaqu Pacha Uruguay has collaborated with Brazilian researchers in the Gephyreus Project. The goal of this project is to estimate the total abundance of Lahille's bottlenose dolphin in southern Brazil and Uruguay and to assess its risk of extinction (founded by Yaqu Pacha Germany, totally granted 2021 for Uruguayan counterpart $5000).\r\n\r\nOur last project (2021-2022), funded by ECCOSUR (grant received: USD 10.000) was \u201cLahille's bottlenose dolphin the coastal sentinel: tourism, environmental education, and integrated management\u201d. This project involved a vulnerability analysis of climate change effects on Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin, as well as a promotion of the species as a sentinel and flag species of the Uruguayan oceanic coast. We engaged educators and schoolchildren in various areas of the country, mainly on the coast, tourist operators, and other local actors in environmental education activities to increase their awareness of the problems faced by the coastal system due to the effects of climate change and in particular, to see their effects on the Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn Uruguay, the Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin population is small (approximately 70 individuals), has a restricted distribution, and is extremely coastal. It also has a high residence of photo-identified individuals, and high mobility waters of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary and southern Brazilian waters, where there is high mortality in artisanal fishing nets. In addition, this population belongs to the same management unit and evolutionary unit as the dolphins from southern Brazil, showing low genetic diversity. Due to all of the above, the dolphin was included in the list of priority species for the conservation of the National System of Protected Areas of Uruguay. The results of the investigations also contributed to the recognition of this dolphin as a subspecies and for its evaluation by the IUCN in the Vulnerable category. Although very little information exists on possible direct and indirect threats to the subspecies in Uruguayan waters, contamination from agricultural effluents could be a source of concern due to the pollutant load detected in other marine organisms in areas of the high occurrence of Lahille\u2019s Bottlenose Dolphins. Reduced prey availability caused by overfishing and destruction of benthic ecosystems due to fisheries is other possible threats for the subspecies in Uruguay. Incidental capture of Lahille\u2019s Bottlenose Dolphins in fishing gear in Uruguay is rare. However, in the last 2 years, at least five animals were recorded\u00a0stranded, two of them with bycatch signs from fishing nets located 300m from the coast (\u201csubsistence fishery\u201d).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main priorities are:\r\n\r\n-To resume systematic boat surveys between La Paloma and Punta del Diablo (principally Esmeralda-south to Cabo Polonio) for photo-id and acoustic records. Catalog update. Population monitoring\r\n\r\n-To make a new abundance estimate on the Uruguayan coast as well as other population parameters (survival, birth interval, movement patterns, residency).\u00a0\r\n\r\n-To get in-depth about the effects of Climate Change on dolphin occurrence and distribution.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n-To test hypotheses regarding the occurrence of dolphins and coastal upwellings.\r\n\r\n-To continue coordinated efforts with Brazil, focusing on whistle analysis, especially of signature whistles and catalog construction, social structure analysis, and individual movement analyses.\r\n\r\n-To start studies regarding contaminant levels in the tissues of dolphins.\r\n\r\n-To biopsy samples for genetic, social structure, and forging ecology studies.\r\n\r\n-To include an anthropological perspective for historical data on the occurrence of Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin in Rio de la Plata Estuary.\r\n-To monitor mortality (Stranding network).\r\n\r\n-To promote citizen science: records of dolphins by citizens\u00a0all along the Uruguayan coast\r\n\r\n-To keep visiting local schools to engage schoolchildren in environmental education activities.\r\n\r\n-To keep raising awareness of the effects of climate change on Lahille\u2019s bottlenose dolphin population and the importance of conservation of the coastal marine ecosystem.\r\n\r\n-To explore blockchain technology's potential to build up shared databases of photo-id and whistles catalogs between other research groups working on dolphin population\r\nons.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpacts on the DeSci community\r\n\u00a0\r\n1. As one of the first Latin American projects in DeSci, we will contribute to enhancing awareness of the DeSci movement across these latitudes, which will promote its expansion and increase its diversity.\r\n\u00a0\r\n2. We will also contribute to opening DeSci to other different disciplines. Opening DeSci to conservation biology projects will also promote DeSci diversity and the inclusion of more descientists and different perspectives.\r\n\u00a0\r\n3. We will demonstrate the efficiency of quadratic funding as an alternative way of funding often underfunded projects such as those of non-profit, independent, research groups working on conservation biology and focusing on climate change effects on biodiversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   If we take care of the dolphins\ud83d\udc2c, we take care of the coast \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\r\n   If we take care of the coast \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f, we take care of the dolphins\ud83d\udc2c",

For more details, see our paper and video here.\r\nOne key cause is that the mechanisms for collective signalling (likes, comments, hashtags, and other forms of social annotation), and the algorithms that drive our collective behavior therefrom, are siloed away by centralized platforms whose primary incentives of corporate profit are misaligned with broader societal good.\r\nThese signals are a form of stigmergy, a foundational coordination mechanism in which individual signalling (such as pheromone trails in ants) drives emergent collective intelligent behavior.\r\nThe vital importance of stigmergic signals (or markers) to the health of our information ecosystems raises the question: what if not just our content, but our attention signals (aka stigmergic markers ) could be published in a decentralized form on a scale that would make interesting emergent innovation possible?\r\nAlgorithmically-aided collective behavior (e.g., sensemaking and collective intelligence applications) would then be available to anyone for experimentation, opening the door to impactful applications, as well as better scientific and ethical oversight over collective behavior.\r\nHerein we propose to:\r\nCreate a schema\/protocol for publishing such signals and providing open, decentralized and platform-agnostic access to them.\r\nBootstrap a large decentralized near-real-time corpus of annotation signals from existing social behavior, initially via Twitter\u2019s API.\r\nCreate reference implementations of the kinds of open source attention applications made possible, e.g. aggregation of annotations to specific URLs, quality \/ reliability indicators for web content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The protocol aims to provide an automated stablecoin mechanism, with minimization of control and human influence, which brings decentralized and algorithmic money to the entire space of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nAtmos includes 2 tokens in the protocol ecosystem: Atmos token \"ATM\" and Atmos stablecoin \"aUSD\".\r\n\r\nThe protocol design distinguishes the following features:\r\n\r\nFractional-Algorithmic Model\r\n\r\naUSD - an automated, fractional-algorithmic token with a floating\/unbacked supply, meaning that the part of the supply is backed by the collateral and a part stays algorithmic. Atmos Protocol issues aUSD, which attempts to target a particular price index ($1 value), using a targeting mechanism. If aUSD is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If aUSD is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio. More references:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.stakingrewards.com\/journal\/can-an-algorithmic-stablecoin-survive\/\r\nhttps:\/\/vitalik.eth.limo\/general\/2022\/05\/25\/stable.html\r\n\r\nOn-chain Oracles\r\n\r\nAtmos uses dynamic TWAP (time-weighted average prices) and on-chain oracles.\r\n\r\nDual Tokenomics\r\n\r\naUSD is partially backed by the ATM - a share token of the Atmos protocol, which endows holders with the following utilities: governance, revenue sharing, fee accumulation, and yielding rewards.\r\n\r\nMinimized Governance\r\n\r\nAs long as aUSD offers a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management, having bugs or governance vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAtmos Protocol\u2019s Autonomous Workflow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap (till 2022)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace in the Aurora ecosystem\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key strategic partnerships are:\r\n\r\nFlux Protocol - a cross-chain oracle providing smart contracts with economically secure data. Since Atmos is an autonomous protocol that delivers stablecoin with the fractional-algorithmic model as a product, we need to get the reliable and correct price data feed.\r\nRouter Protocol - an infrastructure for cross-chain communication. Atmos Protocol will integrate Router's Widget to give our users an option to perform cross-chain transactions directly from Atmos dApp\u2019s UI.\r\nAurigami - a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol. Atmos AMO \u2014 Automated Market Operation will automatically deposit up to 85% of idle USDC collateral into Aurigami's USDC lending pool.\r\nTrisolaris - \u2116 1 DEX on the NEAR's Aurora EVM. Atmos Protocol will deploy main liquidity pairs on the Trisolaris DEX at the launch. The liquidity mining event will be available via Trisolaris pools from day 1!\r\n\r\nThose strategic cooperations will confidently lead Atmos Protocol to the MVP release with the all-needed functionality and recognition among other protocols in the entire Aurora blockchain space.\r\n\r\n$ATM Token Economy\r\nAll the utility in the Atmos Protocol is concentrated in Atmos (ATM) token. ATM - is the governance token in the Atmos ecosystem which plays a significant role in the protocol autonomous operation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supply of ATM is originally fixed at 100 million tokens at genesis, however, the number in circulation is anticipated to be deflationary as aUSD is minted at increasing algorithmic ratios. The protocol is designed in such a way that ATM supply would be primarily deflationary as long as aUSD demand will grow.\r\n\r\nATM Distribution\r\nThe greater amount of tokens will be distributed into the market through the liquidity mining program and will reward liquidity providers for their contribution.\r\n\r\nThe total ATM supply - 100,000,000 units.\r\n\r\nCommunity (75%)\r\n75,000,000 ATM will be distributed among various liquidity mining programs \/ farming \/ staking. The ATM emission is not set at a fixed rate for the whole distribution period and it can be changed by adjusting new rates through the governance proposals.\r\n\r\nPublic Offering (10%)*\r\n10,000,000 ATM are reserved for the public sale event which will be held before the protocol launch. Distribution has a design of linear vesting terms.\r\n\r\nTreasury (15%)\r\n15,000,000 ATM are reserved for the Treasury. Distribution has a design of linear vesting terms. The aim of this allocation lies in the following needs:\r\n\r\nSecurity Bug Bounties\r\nPartnerships\r\nMarketing\r\nCommunity Grants\r\n\r\nWe are in touch with NearStarter and NearPad concerning the $ATM token launch.\r\n\r\nGrant Request\r\n\r\nThe requested amount: $30,000\r\n\r\nThe purposes of the grant:\r\n\r\nMarketing strategies and further community building-up\r\nat least 1 audit report from the leading blockchain security firm\r\nwages payments\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, waiting for you on the protocol launch!\r\n",

		"title": "Web3 Documentary About Nigerian Human Trafficking",
		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7596\/web3-documentary-about-nigerian-human-trafficking",
		"description": "TL;DR: Human trafficking is a problem in Nigeria. We asked traditional organizations for help but they declined. Web3 is making this documentary possible, which has become a part of the story itself. Our documentary educates communities about predatory practices used by traffickers and lays a blueprint for Nigerians to collaborate with Web3 to address local issues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Problem: A Human Trafficking Crisis in Nigeria\r\n\r\nHuman trafficking is defined as the illegal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain, constituting modern-day slavery. As of 2014 human trafficking represented a $150 billion global industry. Two-thirds of this figure ($99 billion) was generated from commercial sexual exploitation.\r\n\r\nNigeria remains an origin point, throughway, and destination country for human trafficking. Recent estimates suggest victims number over 1,386,000, ranking Nigeria in the 81st percentile compared to other countries. A 2003 report stated trafficking was so enmeshed in Benin City, Nigeria that most families had at least one member involved in trafficking as either a victim or trafficker.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe long history of trafficking associated with this area in Nigeria persists to recent years. In 2017 over 75% of women migrants arriving in Italy were both victims of sexual exploitation and hailed from Edo State, which contains Benin City.\r\nVictims of human trafficking experience horrific violence and hardship both on their journey to their destination country, and also when they arrive. Advocacy group Pathfinders reports individuals are abused physically, gang-raped, and infected with various sexually transmitted diseases.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe U.S. State Department categorizes the Nigerian government as attempting but ultimately failing to comply with accepted standards for eliminating human trafficking.\r\n\r\nRejected By Trad Organizations, Embraced by Web3\u00a0\r\n\r\nA group of Nigerian journalists led by Existential Zoomer set out to investigate human trafficking, highlight methods for prevention, and suggest how social programs can help survivors heal.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen we reached out to traditional organizations in Nigeria to solicit funding for a documentary they declined, saying human trafficking is a \u201cheavy topic.\u201d Additionally, acknowledging human trafficking can be seen as indirectly critiquing the government and therefore carries political risk.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThus we turned to Web3 and found financial and technical support in PeopleDAO. Seed funding of $7.7k allowed us to travel to Benin City in early June and produce an initial report capturing the stories of survivors and analyzing the factors contributing to human trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrowdfunding a Documentary\r\n\r\nBuilding on the momentum, we aim to produce a feature-length documentary, The Lost Children of Benin City, bringing attention to the social problem of women and children being trafficked in and out of Nigeria. We have partnered with a production company, Singularity Media, which has experience placing content on major streaming platforms.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWeb3 itself has become part of the story, because it provided us the support when traditional organizations would not. Nigerian art-makers cite a lack of interest and patronage from international players. Our documentary will expand the imagination of global audiences, providing the blueprint for more international collaboration to produce content about Web3\u2019s relationship with Africa.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will use the documentary to \u201csensitive\u201d Nigerian communities, both urban and rural, teaching them about how to avoid tactics employed by human traffickers. In showing them the documentary we simultaneously affirm to Nigerian communities that Web3 holds value beyond being a medium for financial capital, but can also act as a vehicle for garnering support and creating social impact.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe hope you will consider funding this effort.",

		"url": "https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/grants\/7597\/scriptus-a-marketplace-for-research-as-collectibl",
		"description": "What is Scriptus?\r\nScriptus is a marketplace for research as collectible art. From the researchers' perspective, Scriptus offers a drop-in replacement of traditional pre-print hosting platforms (e.g. arxiv.org), that also enables researchers to receive additional research funding with zero overhead (i.e. no gofundme page or additional grant proposals needed).\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor supporters of science, Scriptus offers a direct channel for them to support the research that they care about. Unlike donating to traditional non-profit scientific organizations, where only a fraction of the dollar donated goes towards researchers (the rest goes towards running the non-profit), when people support researchers on Scriptus, 100% of their money goes directly into the researcher's wallet. No more haircuts from intermediary institutions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Scriptus provides a marketplace for people to trade their donations. This market mechanism enables two important functions. First, it injects long-term liquidity into the science funding infrastructure. Put simply, Scriptus makes it possible for future donors to support today\u2019s scientific research. Secondly, it offers price discovery for research impact: higher impact research will receive more interest from supporters of science, and the market mechanism will drive the price higher. This price will in turn allow researchers to uncover higher impact papers more easily.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow does Scriptus work?\u00a0\r\nResearchers upload papers to Scriptus the same way as they do on traditional platforms, and Scriptus will in turn mint N-shares of fractional NFTs that represent that research project. Once the paper is uploaded, the content of the research is free for everyone, regardless of who owns the NFTs that represent the paper. Then, the researcher can list the NFTs for sale on the Scriptus marketplace, where supporters of science can discover and support the research project by purchasing the research NFT. Owners of existing research NFTs can also resell it anytime, effectively providing liquidity to science funding during the period of their ownership.\r\n\r\nWhy is Scriptus potentially impactful?\u00a0\r\nWe are excited about Scriptus because we think it can solve\/improve the three causes of the stagnation we see in science today: long-term liquidity issue in science funding, misallocation of research funding and effort, and increased science friction. We had already briefly discussed how Scriptus enables long-term liquidity provision of research, and reduces science friction by making high impact research more visible. Scriptus additionally will help incentivize meaningful and important research by aligning the interests between researchers and the public. Traditional science funding sources are either highly influenced by special interests (i.e. industry funding typically focuses on narrow areas pertinent to the company\u2019 product), or plagued by a very noisy and inefficient selection process. As a result, high impact projects are not being funded, and the selection process for grants and publications are weakly correlated with quality. By providing a direct channel between the public and the researchers, Scriptus allows the public to loudly voice their opinion on the most urgent research that needs to be funded first.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor a more complete discussion of how Scriptus will accelerate the science progress, see https:\/\/github.com\/ScriptusApp\/whitepaper\/blob\/main\/part1.pdf for our whitepaper.\r\n\r\nWho are we?\r\nThe founder of Scriptus is Steven, who has recently completed his PhD in Operations Research at Columbia University, where he focused on various online learning and mechanism design problems. We also have the support of many professors and PhD students from various institutions including Columbia, Princeton, Stanford, and Harvard.\r\n\r\n",

The goal is to measure how much it would cost to forge each of those methods. The measurement will be done through Upala\u2019s price of forgery protocol. See Benefits of Price of Forgery for Gitcoin.\r\n\r\nMoney from this grant will be used exclusively to fill the pools. In short we gonna use this money to bribe bots away from Gitcoin and see which human verification methods are \u201ccheaper\u201d. Check out the video to learn more - how Price of forgery works.\r\n\r\nAnd my dearest humans and bots please consider donating Upala itself as well. \r\n\r\nGitcoin and Upala integration\r\n\r\nIn short Upala and Gitcoin integration looks as follows. Upala grabs users from GC passport, outputs liquidated bots and evaluates human verification methods. Gitcoin sends funds to it (like a service fee), tries to attract as many bots as possible and uses collected data to tweak trust bonus and sanction malicious actors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInputs:\r\nUsers. Users are fed from Gitcoin Passport. Upala learns which addresses  have which verification methods passed.\r\n$$. Budget is allocated in pools in order for the protocol to work.\r\nOutputs:\r\nBots. The list of liquidated bots. Sanctions to be applied to these users (should be restricted or deleted from Gitcoin).\r\nHV PoFs. Price of Forgery for every human verification method. It makes sense to tie trust bonus to this data. Or use it for KPIs (\ud83d\udc1aA follow up for the Green pilled episode with Upala)\r\nCheques. Liquidation cheques are used by bots to liquidate. Should be published somewhere public and promoted.\r\n\r\nMeasuring the PoFs is the first step\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s definitely a lot of potential here for automation. We could automate trust bonus adjustments depending on PoF for example and do other cool stuff (see benefits). But it is not necessary to integrate full scale.\r\n\r\nAs a first step we can measure PoFs, get new insights (with the help of FDD team data) and decide on the next steps. We can do trust bonus setup and sanctioning in manual mode for now.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nBudgeting. Pools must be filled with real money. The way those funds are going to be spent are described here - \ud83e\uddffGentle PoF discovery methodology and budget.\r\n\r\nPromotion. Bots need to know the rules of the game. And they need to be attracted. Promotion campaign is described here -\ud83d\udc88Signalling bots (working document)\r\n\r\nTechnical details.

		"description": "This grant will fund scholarships of $45\/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Pode Crer program?\r\n\r\nPode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to \"one can believe\" but on daily use means something like \"right on!\") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florian\u00f3polis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.\r\n\r\nPode Crer 2021 Impact\u00a0\r\n\r\n320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted\u00a0 at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.\r\n\r\nOther ways to support\r\n\r\nYou can learn more in English about the Vilson Groh Institute and Pode Crer at https:\/\/vilsongroh.org\u00a0 and in Portuguese at https:\/\/redeivg.org.br\/podecrer\r\nTo make a tax deductible donation in USD with a credit card, you can use the designated fund we created together with the BrazilFoundation, an American 501(c)3\u00a0 https:\/\/www.brazilfoundation.org\/podecrerfund\/\r\n\r\nTo make a donation in Brazilian reais you can use the Portuguese website donation page: https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/doe-agora\/\r\n\r\nIf you make a donation, please email Eduardo at eduardo@redeivg.org.br or tweet @podecrerproject\r\n\r\nThis GitCoin grant is managed by Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame (https:\/\/munfred.com) on behalf of the Vilson Groh Institute (https:\/\/redeivg.org.br)\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow, photos of the 2021 and 2022 iterations of the Pode Crer project together with student testimonials and additional information on the Vilson Groh Institute\u2019s history and vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nTrack 1, ages 11-4\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nTracks 2 and 3, ages 14+\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nStudent stories from the 2021 Pode Crer pilot iteration\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nAppendix\r\nVision, history and leadership\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pode Crer Vision\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florian\u00f3polis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Vilson Groh Institute\r\nPode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,\u00a0 a Brazilian nonprofit that\u00a0 coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nThe Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh\u2019s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI\r\nSummary of impact the past 10 years\r\nIn addition to Pode Crer, the Vilson Groh Institute operates several other social programs that are primarily focused on youth, education, culture, community support, and family support. They reach deep into very violent communities and over years have radically changed and improved the lives of many people heavily involved with drug trafficking, violence, dysfunctional families, and lack of social and economic opportunities\r\n\r\n== An average of 4800 people took part in the institute\u2019s programs each year\r\n== Over 7M meals offered\r\n== About $110 mean monthly investment per children in school programs\r\n== 1500 children current enrolled in full time education across partner organizations\r\n== 1000 children currently enrolled in part time education across partner organizations\r\n== 2200 families supported per year\r\n== An average of 300 volunteers each year\r\n== 225 university scholarships were provided\r\n== 450 people admitted to university after preparation courses\r\n== 2100 youth got their first job after training\r\n\r\nSocial impact reports (in Portuguese) with detailed numbers between 2013 to 2021 are available at https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/relatorios-sociais\/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big picture problem\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCreating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders\r\nThe Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.\r\n\r\nPode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers\r\nThe plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florian\u00f3polis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florian\u00f3polis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palho\u00e7a. The first is home to CEDEP (https:\/\/cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https:\/\/ajp2.org.br\/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were given $500M what would you do?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBecause Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the \u200b\u200bFlorian\u00f3polis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are talking with the Stanford University \u201cLemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil\u201d to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful \u201csmart city\u201d experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florian\u00f3polis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?\r\n\r\n\u00a0If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach\u00a0 an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.\r\n\r\nTo have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.\u00a0 Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn\u2019t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn his book \u201c\u200b\u200bThe Knowledge Economy\u201d, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered\u00a0 to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?\r\n\r\nImmediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023\r\nBecause of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).\r\n\r\nGoing beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers\r\n\r\n\r\nPode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.\r\n\r\nA center costs $1.2M to build and $300k\/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\u00a0 To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Budget - currently $250k\/year for 300 youth\r\nThe 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.\r\n\r\nIn the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).\r\n\r\nStudent support scholarships ($40\/mo)\r\n\r\nAnother challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical space and locations\r\nThe secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florian\u00f3polis and track 1 in the city of Palho\u00e7a. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeam growth\r\nFinally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe story of Vilson Groh\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nVilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.\r\n\r\n\r\nVilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florian\u00f3polis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking\r\n\u00a0Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today.\u00a0\r\nEvery day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe Vilson Groh Network\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThrough Vilson Groh\u2019s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.\r\nIt should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.\r\nToday the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:\r\n== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire\u2019s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults\r\n== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed\r\n== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents\r\n== MESSJ (Marist School S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents\r\n== CCEA (Slave Anast\u00e1cia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program\r\n== ACAM (Mocot\u00f3 Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families\r\n== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau\r\n== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther detailed information about the impact of each of these organizations, check the Institute 2021 social impact report and reports from other years in the institute\u2019s social reports page\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal statement\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https:\/\/munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br\r\nI have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.",

		"description": "This grant will fund scholarships of $45\/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Pode Crer program?\r\n\r\nPode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to \"one can believe\" but on daily use means something like \"right on!\") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florian\u00f3polis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.\r\n\r\nPode Crer 2021 Impact\u00a0\r\n\r\n320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted\u00a0 at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.\r\n\r\nOther ways to support\r\n\r\nYou can learn more in English about the Vilson Groh Institute and Pode Crer at https:\/\/vilsongroh.org\u00a0 and in Portuguese at https:\/\/redeivg.org.br\/podecrer\r\nTo make a tax deductible donation in USD with a credit card, you can use the designated fund we created together with the BrazilFoundation, an American 501(c)3\u00a0 https:\/\/www.brazilfoundation.org\/podecrerfund\/\r\n\r\nTo make a donation in Brazilian reais you can use the Portuguese website donation page: https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/doe-agora\/\r\n\r\nIf you make a donation, please email Eduardo at eduardo@redeivg.org.br or tweet @podecrerproject\r\n\r\nThis GitCoin grant is managed by Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame (https:\/\/munfred.com) on behalf of the Vilson Groh Institute (https:\/\/redeivg.org.br)\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow, photos of the 2021 and 2022 iterations of the Pode Crer project together with student testimonials and additional information on the Vilson Groh Institute\u2019s history and vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nTrack 1, ages 11-4\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nTracks 2 and 3, ages 14+\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nStudent stories from the 2021 Pode Crer pilot iteration\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nAppendix\r\nVision, history and leadership\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pode Crer Vision\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florian\u00f3polis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Vilson Groh Institute\r\nPode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,\u00a0 a Brazilian nonprofit that\u00a0 coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nThe Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh\u2019s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI\r\nSummary of impact the past 10 years\r\nIn addition to Pode Crer, the Vilson Groh Institute operates several other social programs that are primarily focused on youth, education, culture, community support, and family support. They reach deep into very violent communities and over years have radically changed and improved the lives of many people heavily involved with drug trafficking, violence, dysfunctional families, and lack of social and economic opportunities\r\n\r\n== An average of 4800 people took part in the institute\u2019s programs each year\r\n== Over 7M meals offered\r\n== About $110 mean monthly investment per children in school programs\r\n== 1500 children current enrolled in full time education across partner organizations\r\n== 1000 children currently enrolled in part time education across partner organizations\r\n== 2200 families supported per year\r\n== An average of 300 volunteers each year\r\n== 225 university scholarships were provided\r\n== 450 people admitted to university after preparation courses\r\n== 2100 youth got their first job after training\r\n\r\nSocial impact reports (in Portuguese) with detailed numbers between 2013 to 2021 are available at https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/relatorios-sociais\/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big picture problem\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCreating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders\r\nThe Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.\r\n\r\nPode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers\r\nThe plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florian\u00f3polis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florian\u00f3polis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palho\u00e7a. The first is home to CEDEP (https:\/\/cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https:\/\/ajp2.org.br\/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were given $500M what would you do?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBecause Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the \u200b\u200bFlorian\u00f3polis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are talking with the Stanford University \u201cLemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil\u201d to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful \u201csmart city\u201d experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florian\u00f3polis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?\r\n\r\n\u00a0If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach\u00a0 an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.\r\n\r\nTo have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.\u00a0 Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn\u2019t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn his book \u201c\u200b\u200bThe Knowledge Economy\u201d, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered\u00a0 to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?\r\n\r\nImmediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023\r\nBecause of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).\r\n\r\nGoing beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers\r\n\r\n\r\nPode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.\r\n\r\nA center costs $1.2M to build and $300k\/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\u00a0 To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Budget - currently $250k\/year for 300 youth\r\nThe 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.\r\n\r\nIn the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).\r\n\r\nStudent support scholarships ($40\/mo)\r\n\r\nAnother challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical space and locations\r\nThe secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florian\u00f3polis and track 1 in the city of Palho\u00e7a. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeam growth\r\nFinally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe story of Vilson Groh\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nVilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.\r\n\r\n\r\nVilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florian\u00f3polis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking\r\n\u00a0Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today.\u00a0\r\nEvery day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe Vilson Groh Network\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThrough Vilson Groh\u2019s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.\r\nIt should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.\r\nToday the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:\r\n== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire\u2019s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults\r\n== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed\r\n== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents\r\n== MESSJ (Marist School S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents\r\n== CCEA (Slave Anast\u00e1cia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program\r\n== ACAM (Mocot\u00f3 Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families\r\n== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau\r\n== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther detailed information about the impact of each of these organizations, check the Institute 2021 social impact report and reports from other years in the institute\u2019s social reports page\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal statement\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https:\/\/munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br\r\nI have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.",

		"description": "This grant will fund scholarships of $45\/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Pode Crer program?\r\n\r\nPode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to \"one can believe\" but on daily use means something like \"right on!\") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florian\u00f3polis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.\r\n\r\nPode Crer 2021 Impact\u00a0\r\n\r\n320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted\u00a0 at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.\r\n\r\nOther ways to support\r\n\r\nYou can learn more in English about the Vilson Groh Institute and Pode Crer at https:\/\/vilsongroh.org\u00a0 and in Portuguese at https:\/\/redeivg.org.br\/podecrer\r\nTo make a tax deductible donation in USD with a credit card, you can use the designated fund we created together with the BrazilFoundation, an American 501(c)3\u00a0 https:\/\/www.brazilfoundation.org\/podecrerfund\/\r\n\r\nTo make a donation in Brazilian reais you can use the Portuguese website donation page: https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/doe-agora\/\r\n\r\nIf you make a donation, please email Eduardo at eduardo@redeivg.org.br or tweet @podecrerproject\r\n\r\nThis GitCoin grant is managed by Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame (https:\/\/munfred.com) on behalf of the Vilson Groh Institute (https:\/\/redeivg.org.br)\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow, photos of the 2021 and 2022 iterations of the Pode Crer project together with student testimonials and additional information on the Vilson Groh Institute\u2019s history and vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nTrack 1, ages 11-4\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nTracks 2 and 3, ages 14+\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nStudent stories from the 2021 Pode Crer pilot iteration\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nAppendix\r\nVision, history and leadership\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pode Crer Vision\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florian\u00f3polis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Vilson Groh Institute\r\nPode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,\u00a0 a Brazilian nonprofit that\u00a0 coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nThe Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh\u2019s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI\r\nSummary of impact the past 10 years\r\nIn addition to Pode Crer, the Vilson Groh Institute operates several other social programs that are primarily focused on youth, education, culture, community support, and family support. They reach deep into very violent communities and over years have radically changed and improved the lives of many people heavily involved with drug trafficking, violence, dysfunctional families, and lack of social and economic opportunities\r\n\r\n== An average of 4800 people took part in the institute\u2019s programs each year\r\n== Over 7M meals offered\r\n== About $110 mean monthly investment per children in school programs\r\n== 1500 children current enrolled in full time education across partner organizations\r\n== 1000 children currently enrolled in part time education across partner organizations\r\n== 2200 families supported per year\r\n== An average of 300 volunteers each year\r\n== 225 university scholarships were provided\r\n== 450 people admitted to university after preparation courses\r\n== 2100 youth got their first job after training\r\n\r\nSocial impact reports (in Portuguese) with detailed numbers between 2013 to 2021 are available at https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/relatorios-sociais\/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big picture problem\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCreating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders\r\nThe Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.\r\n\r\nPode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers\r\nThe plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florian\u00f3polis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florian\u00f3polis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palho\u00e7a. The first is home to CEDEP (https:\/\/cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https:\/\/ajp2.org.br\/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were given $500M what would you do?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBecause Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the \u200b\u200bFlorian\u00f3polis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are talking with the Stanford University \u201cLemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil\u201d to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful \u201csmart city\u201d experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florian\u00f3polis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?\r\n\r\n\u00a0If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach\u00a0 an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.\r\n\r\nTo have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.\u00a0 Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn\u2019t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn his book \u201c\u200b\u200bThe Knowledge Economy\u201d, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered\u00a0 to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?\r\n\r\nImmediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023\r\nBecause of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).\r\n\r\nGoing beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers\r\n\r\n\r\nPode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.\r\n\r\nA center costs $1.2M to build and $300k\/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\u00a0 To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Budget - currently $250k\/year for 300 youth\r\nThe 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.\r\n\r\nIn the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).\r\n\r\nStudent support scholarships ($40\/mo)\r\n\r\nAnother challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical space and locations\r\nThe secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florian\u00f3polis and track 1 in the city of Palho\u00e7a. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeam growth\r\nFinally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe story of Vilson Groh\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nVilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.\r\n\r\n\r\nVilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florian\u00f3polis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking\r\n\u00a0Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today.\u00a0\r\nEvery day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe Vilson Groh Network\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThrough Vilson Groh\u2019s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.\r\nIt should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.\r\nToday the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:\r\n== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire\u2019s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults\r\n== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed\r\n== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents\r\n== MESSJ (Marist School S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents\r\n== CCEA (Slave Anast\u00e1cia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program\r\n== ACAM (Mocot\u00f3 Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families\r\n== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau\r\n== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther detailed information about the impact of each of these organizations, check the Institute 2021 social impact report and reports from other years in the institute\u2019s social reports page\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal statement\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https:\/\/munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br\r\nI have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.",

		"description": "This grant will fund scholarships of $45\/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Pode Crer program?\r\n\r\nPode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to \"one can believe\" but on daily use means something like \"right on!\") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florian\u00f3polis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.\r\n\r\nPode Crer 2021 Impact\u00a0\r\n\r\n320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted\u00a0 at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.\r\n\r\nOther ways to support\r\n\r\nYou can learn more in English about the Vilson Groh Institute and Pode Crer at https:\/\/vilsongroh.org\u00a0 and in Portuguese at https:\/\/redeivg.org.br\/podecrer\r\nTo make a tax deductible donation in USD with a credit card, you can use the designated fund we created together with the BrazilFoundation, an American 501(c)3\u00a0 https:\/\/www.brazilfoundation.org\/podecrerfund\/\r\n\r\nTo make a donation in Brazilian reais you can use the Portuguese website donation page: https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/doe-agora\/\r\n\r\nIf you make a donation, please email Eduardo at eduardo@redeivg.org.br or tweet @podecrerproject\r\n\r\nThis GitCoin grant is managed by Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame (https:\/\/munfred.com) on behalf of the Vilson Groh Institute (https:\/\/redeivg.org.br)\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow, photos of the 2021 and 2022 iterations of the Pode Crer project together with student testimonials and additional information on the Vilson Groh Institute\u2019s history and vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nTrack 1, ages 11-4\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nTracks 2 and 3, ages 14+\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nStudent stories from the 2021 Pode Crer pilot iteration\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nAppendix\r\nVision, history and leadership\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pode Crer Vision\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florian\u00f3polis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Vilson Groh Institute\r\nPode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,\u00a0 a Brazilian nonprofit that\u00a0 coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florian\u00f3polis region. The institute\u2019s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.\r\n\r\nThe Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh\u2019s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI\r\nSummary of impact the past 10 years\r\nIn addition to Pode Crer, the Vilson Groh Institute operates several other social programs that are primarily focused on youth, education, culture, community support, and family support. They reach deep into very violent communities and over years have radically changed and improved the lives of many people heavily involved with drug trafficking, violence, dysfunctional families, and lack of social and economic opportunities\r\n\r\n== An average of 4800 people took part in the institute\u2019s programs each year\r\n== Over 7M meals offered\r\n== About $110 mean monthly investment per children in school programs\r\n== 1500 children current enrolled in full time education across partner organizations\r\n== 1000 children currently enrolled in part time education across partner organizations\r\n== 2200 families supported per year\r\n== An average of 300 volunteers each year\r\n== 225 university scholarships were provided\r\n== 450 people admitted to university after preparation courses\r\n== 2100 youth got their first job after training\r\n\r\nSocial impact reports (in Portuguese) with detailed numbers between 2013 to 2021 are available at https:\/\/www.redeivg.org.br\/relatorios-sociais\/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big picture problem\r\nWe want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florian\u00f3polis region in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCreating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders\r\nThe Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.\r\n\r\nPode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers\r\nThe plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florian\u00f3polis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florian\u00f3polis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palho\u00e7a. The first is home to CEDEP (https:\/\/cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https:\/\/ajp2.org.br\/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were given $500M what would you do?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBecause Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the \u200b\u200bFlorian\u00f3polis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are talking with the Stanford University \u201cLemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil\u201d to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful \u201csmart city\u201d experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCrucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florian\u00f3polis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?\r\n\r\n\u00a0If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach\u00a0 an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.\r\n\r\nTo have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.\u00a0 Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn\u2019t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn his book \u201c\u200b\u200bThe Knowledge Economy\u201d, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered\u00a0 to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?\r\n\r\nImmediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023\r\nBecause of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).\r\n\r\nGoing beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers\r\n\r\n\r\nPode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.\r\n\r\nA center costs $1.2M to build and $300k\/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.\u00a0 To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Budget - currently $250k\/year for 300 youth\r\nThe 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.\r\n\r\nIn the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).\r\n\r\nStudent support scholarships ($40\/mo)\r\n\r\nAnother challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical space and locations\r\nThe secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florian\u00f3polis and track 1 in the city of Palho\u00e7a. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeam growth\r\nFinally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe story of Vilson Groh\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nVilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.\r\n\r\n\r\nVilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florian\u00f3polis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florian\u00f3polis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking\r\n\u00a0Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today.\u00a0\r\nEvery day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe Vilson Groh Network\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThrough Vilson Groh\u2019s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.\r\nIt should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.\r\nToday the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:\r\n== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire\u2019s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults\r\n== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed\r\n== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents\r\n== MESSJ (Marist School S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents\r\n== CCEA (Slave Anast\u00e1cia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program\r\n== ACAM (Mocot\u00f3 Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families\r\n== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau\r\n== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther detailed information about the impact of each of these organizations, check the Institute 2021 social impact report and reports from other years in the institute\u2019s social reports page\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal statement\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nPersonal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https:\/\/munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br\r\nI have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.",

On the other hand, tools like Google Calendar or Calendly were designed for scheduling groups within the same company, groups that share the same email domain and don\u2019t mind making their calendar visible to one another. These Web2 tools might work when you\u2019re a corporate employee but are of little use when half your team is anons or some of you work across multiple DAOs.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been building a scheduling tool that\u2019s open-source and DAO-contributor-centric. In the first iteration, we create a Calendly-like functionality with privacy protection: no need to give anyone your email, just share your wallet and the tool will create a calendar invite for each of you, with no need to exchange personal data.\r\n\r\nRecently, we integrated with ENS domains and Lens protocol to make scheduling even easier.\r\n\r\nAnd now, we\u2019re seeking to take scheduling to the next level by enabling the group to find the next available slot, in as few clicks as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease support our project to save us all time, and enable smoother coordination in Web3.

In order to make ends meet they band together with other farmers and pool their resources as part of a cooperative. Even though the co-op gives them a degree of scale to leverage, the affordance of certifications like \"organic\" are too expensive or cumbersome to administrate (because of the plurality of practitioners and plots that would each need to get certified). They are barred at the institutional gates. However these days we can do better! \r\n\r\nEnter LunarPunk_Labs as digital intermediary. \r\n\r\nWe work with smallholders and their representatives to enable them to reach their highest common potential in aggregate. In this case we're talking about agroforestry; so we facilitate workshops to learn about and determine the regenerative functions of their ecosystem (e.g. metrics such as tree diversity on-farm, nearby forest density etc.). We then construct concept notes with the functional requirements for translating their practice-based methodology into credits, credit classes and 'ecological state protocols'. Our assumptions are then checked with our expert advisors and consultants to avoid unintended consequences. Once credits are issued and the protocol goes to market, the co-ops and their members have a new form of revenue. \r\n\r\nMore specifically:\r\nThe wider field of action at play here is the reconciliation of active inference with distributed monitoring, verification and reporting. These instruments are used to convert bottom up practice-based methodologies into hardened concept notes and functional requirements for specifying open-source ecological state protocols. These concept notes are licenced under creative commons, and the protocols will then be deployed on open-source networks (e.g. Regen Registry, Celo, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe significance of this undertaking means that in order to be viable, vital and evolutionary, we'll need to operationalise across several domains of activity at once. Consequently we see our use of funds needing to be distributed across the following organisational ecology: \r\n\r\nUse of funds:\r\n- Research\r\n- Design \r\n- Development \r\n- Marketing \r\n- Education \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\ud83d\udd12 Bypassing gatekeepers to generate equity \ud83d\udd11\r\n\r\nGatekeepers are frustrating because they hold back scientific progress and legitimate regenerative practices with their myopic demands for legibility. We want to help the long tail bypass them in order to onboard a cosmos of eco-credits and other forms of indescribable value that will increase the well-being of life on earth. \r\n\r\n> We are facilitating the development of ecological state protocols that serve people and planet by harnessing markets, science and technology.\r\n\r\nFor whom?\r\n\ud83e\uddde\u200d\u2642\ufe0f The long tail of small-hold farmers; our key metric is a gini coefficient \ud83e\uddde\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\r\n\r\nRegenerative transformation will be driven by the long tail; not the instutitions of academia, government nor big industry. Our energy is best spent there. We serve enviromental stewards and the regenerative technology community at large.\r\n\r\nBeyond this we are aware that disruptive technology brings unintended consequences. JEDIs represent justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in their process design (). \r\n\r\nConsequentially we act as a digital intermediary that helps level the playing field for local earth stewards and their representatives who wish to interact with a rising tide of 'network states' and 'digital republics' (ideally the latter). We do this by facilitating semantic workshops with a transparent (and thus debatable) epistemology. \r\n\r\nTeam:\r\n Josh Fairhead\r\nSelf-certified nut job with a long history in web3 and crypto economic networks.\r\nMost recent outpost: Regen Ledger Governance Coordinator. \r\nPrior paths: Liminal Village, Commons Stack, Giveth and Pillar Project.\r\nSemantic facilitation, ontological design, methodology development.\r\n Maija Grudule\r\nTransdisciplinary weaver.

We\u2019ve created a new alternative source of liquidity by concentrating liquidity of large orders in one place and becoming the platform for OTC in crypto.\r\n\r\nMission:\r\n\r\nWe envision MarsBase as a perfect solution for organizing and forming the secondary OTC market for retail that allows both whales and relates to co-exist and concentrate the liquidity in one place.\r\n\r\nOur primary goal is the creation of a marketplace with coins of medium and low capitalization. The number of available assets will exceed 1000 different blockchain tokens. We estimate that all transactions greater than $50k which are not suitable for large OTC desks will be traded on MarsBase. This way, in 3 years, we are going to take 10% of the trading volume with transactions of up to $50k and a potential income of $1.6 billion.\r\n\r\nThis will allow MarsBase to become the largest decentralized OTC cross-chain ecosystem in DeFi and stabilize the market, making it less risky and more profitable.\r\nThe MarsBase platform consists of several modules with unique features.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problems MarsBase solves:\r\n\r\nDue to the fragmentation of the existing DeFi market and the absence of the infrastructure which can gather the liquidity for high-volume deals of retail investors altogether, the following problems are arising:\r\n\r\n-Large market caps don\u2019t mean deep order books, the OTC market exists for top 10 cryptos and is gated-access.\r\n-For many tokens with large market caps there is no liquidity and no repo possibilities for large buyers\/sellers.\r\n-Niche of unvested tokens and equity remains untapped.\r\n-No one place aggregates OTC trading.\r\n-There are high entry barriers to OTC for retail investors.",

We would like to democratise Web3 and DeFi adoption and fuel decentralisation of funding from the earliest stages.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the values of Web3 and would like to help people access DeFi and early stage crypto funding. This is why we are building on top of our tech an educative investment platform answering to regulators, investors and builders. Users will be able to create an account with KYC\/AML\/KYT procedures in under 5 minutes and open a wallet for which they will keep custody of the private key. By choosing a strategy on our platform (DeFi or early stage), users\u2019 wallets are fed instructions for on-chain transactions, which will be signed by our back-end\u2019s proxy engine.\r\n\r\nOur unique technical-legal framework allows us to always comply with regulators while ensuring higher level of security for users (we do not pool funds, no intermediary in the financial flux, no smart contract attack surface\u2026).\r\n\r\nOur long-term vision is to offer a new, more transparent, secure and virtuous framework for asset management in general, by capitalising on the technical and legal opportunities offered by blockchain, while educating investors about Web3 and breaking its barriers (knowledge, technical, legal, risk management, project analysis\u2026).\r\n\r\nKamea Labs was created in April 2022 and bootstrapped with 34 clients to date by offering manually managed Alpha versions of its product and services: manually managed portfolios of early-stage listed assets and private token sales for ambitious projects:\r\n  - Our Alpha strategy is in closed beta.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- Our Savings strategy is in closed alpha.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0- Our Private sale strategy is in public beta.\r\n\r\nThis allowed us to validate our value proposition and market appetite for it, technical-legal framework and iterate on our strategies and product. We are now ready to go through phase 2 of the project, consisting of:\r\n  - Developing our platform MVP with sign-in, KYC\/AML\/KYT and commit to a strategy features (developer and product designer joining in September 2022).\r\n  - Developing our tech: decentralised proxy engine (Substrate pallets) (undergoing with the help of the Polkadot Relayers acceleration program 2022).

DeSciWorld is dedicated to providing an infrastructure to support this growth in citizen science, independent from traditional institutional funding requirements. Reduction or removal of the gatekeeping present throughout research and academia is our goal; DeSciWorld is making it clear: science is a public good. \r\n\r\nAbout the P2P Research Funding Platform\r\nWinner of the first place prize at ETHSeoul for the Filecoin\/IPFS tract, the P2P Research Funding platform is a simple yet effective piece of blockchain infrastructure that connects researchers and funders in a permissionless and peer-to-peer manner. \r\n\r\nResearchers looking for funding can create a proposal describe their research goals and funding requirements and vye for the attention of benevolent funders. Likewise, funders with a desire to commission a research goal can place a bounty on a subject and accept bids from researchers anywhere in the world to carry out their request. Building this platform on the blockchain allows decentralised and trustless handling of funds and data. \r\n\r\nFeaturing: a smart contract Escrow system that unlocks funding at predefined milestones; decentralised ID (DID) with various tiers of anonymity to accommodate any preference; automated commits of data submissions to IPFS and an independent Review Committee, the P2P Research Funding platform is designed to facilitate a renaissance of citizen science.\r\n\r\nAbout DeSciWorld\r\nDeSciWorld is a community-driven initiative aiming to facilitate the on-boarding of people into the decentralized science (DeSci) space. By providing a suite of products and services that engage and empower would be DeScientists, we will support a second renaissance of science that is inclusive to all, including those peoples and ideas previously left \u201con the outside\u201d due to economic, social or cultural barriers within academia.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\ud83c\udf10 Website\r\n\ud83d\udcd6 Whitepaper\r\n\ud83d\udcac Discord\r\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter\r\n\r\nNote: This fund will be subject to the rigorous governance system that all proposals passing through the DeSciWorld DAO must abide by.

		"description": "This grant is part of the EDEN DAO experiment to use quadratic funding to fund planetary regeneration. Learn more about this radically open experiment here. This project is being championed by Carbonbase because of their exemplary impact.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nIn the Brazilian Amazon, forest land that is not used for \"productive activities\" can be claimed by the government then turned into cattle ranches or exploited by illegal loggers. Revenue from this offset project helps local villagers to acquire legal land ownership rights of their ancestral home and protect it from being taken over by the cattle and logging industry. It will also pay for agroforestry training workshops so that the locals can improve their livelihoods (i.e. by planting sustainable cacao trees) while protecting the rainforest. The covered area protects over 400 families from being displaced and empowers them to protect the forests.\r\n\r\nWhy did we choose this project?\r\n\r\nThe Amazon Rainforest is one of the most precious and diverse natural resources on the planet, but also one of the most vulnerable to disappear for commercial purposes. The location of the project makes it an ideal area to be protected, standing at the edge of the deforestation frontier: about 95 percent of all deforestation occurs within 50 kilometers of highways or roads. The government plans a highway to go through the project area - this project is the last defense to prevent destruction. The project builds up the local community's capacity to monitor and evacuate loggers. The project is part of the award-winning sustainability programs of Allcot, with more than 10 years of experience in forestry project management and training that help deliver sustainable development to the local communities served.\r\n\r\nWhat is the impact of additional funding?\r\n\r\nFunding prevents 3,000 hectares from being deforested annually. For every hectare of land (the size of a rugby field) not cut down or used for cattle pasture, there are 500 tons of CO2 stored in trees (above and below ground). This project supports the local population: over 400 families will no longer fear being displaced. By contributing to the project, you empower the local people to protect the forest. The amount of reduction in emissions through avoidance for the entire project is 553,273 tons of CO2 per year.

We are building a community for people who are passionate about creating art with light. We want to be together, and we love to display enormous, generous images in outdoor spaces to delight, inform and inspire the public.\r\nIn part, our purpose is to raise awareness around causes and groups that need visibility, and we want to partner with organizations to educate the public about the collective, public, or social benefit of the organization. \r\nWe also want to support digital artists by putting their indoor digital art outside on buildings. We want to educate artists about DAOs and Crypto advocacy.\r\nWe desire to teach what we have learned to the members of our DAO and other interested parties. We will educate organizations about the DAO and Crypto space and the workings of the ETH network. We will educate our partners and the public about DAO formation and the benefits of DAO governance, and onboard them to Web3.\r\nWe are people who want to spend all of our time in Web3. We are passionate about changing the world through this technology, and we can\u2019t help but talk about it all the time.\r\n\r\nMandates\r\nAwareness - build visibility for causes, partner with orgs and artists that want visibility\r\nOnboarding - DAO Community building, Crypto education\r\nEmpowerment - learn and teach mechanics of projection art, carry out light actions\r\n\r\nProof of Concept\r\nDuring multiple conferences such as ETHDenver 2022, NFT NYC 2022, FutureShape360 2022, and Crypto Connect Expo 2022, we demonstrated the power of outdoor projection art, and showed proof of concept in these ways:\r\n\r\nProjection art will delight and inspire the public. We projected five times during the conference, creating a buzz, and received loads of positive feedback, \u2018that\u2019s so cool,\u2019 \u2018beautiful and powerful\u2019 and \u2018can you do that for our organization.\u2019 People on the street really resonated with the messages projected. They were stopping to take pictures and post to social media, calling friends to look, and were happy to scan our QR code to learn more!\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "Privacy is a public good. Surveillance capitalism results from coordination failures to protect it.\r\n\r\nThe recent AFAC ruling that outlawed financial privacy in crypto proves this point: we need better coordination mechanisms to protect the technological commons \u2014 in our product design, in regulatory policy, and in the public consciousness.\r\n\r\nYeet is on a trifold mission to address this collective action problem by:\r\n\r\nGuiding the web3 dialogue toward a consensus around commonly accepted ethical standards and practices for privacy, dignity, and consent in emerging tech\r\nReduce the coordination costs among founders, investors, and operators who share these goals\r\nSecure an agentic, anti-authoritarian, self-sovereign technological future\r\n\r\nWhy\r\n\r\nIt is helpful to think of privacy, consent, and human dignity as a commons \u2014 one that needs protection through the collective action of decentralized but highly-coordinated individuals committed to building agentic, ethical technologies. We must collectively exit the game theoretic race to build, ship, and break things faster than the other guy \u2014 all the while concentrating the benefits and socializing the costs to secondary users and across generations.\r\n\r\nYeet exists exactly for this reason: to lower the coordination costs among a decentralized network of founders, funders, and operators who all share similar, prosocial technological goals.\r\n\r\nHow\r\n\r\nAt Yeet, we interrogate key concepts, organize fireside chats hosted by internal and external thought leaders, encourage the emergence of ethical design consensus, and produce content that distills the insights from our shared learnings for the broader public.\r\n\r\nYeeters are founders, operators, and investors that represent organizations such as Aspen Institute, Aztec, Bluesky, Centre, Disco, Espresso Systems, Ethereum Foundation, Filecoin, Fission, Flashbots, Polygon, iden3, KYCDAO, Nucleo, Privy, Protocol Labs, Soulbound Labs, and many more projects at the frontier of crypto privacy, identity, and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nPrior and upcoming firesides have included:\r\n\r\nSelf-sovereign data rails with Bluesky\r\nPrivacy as a commons with Privy\r\nUX design discussion: identity, reputation, and community\r\nEncoding prosocial values in game design with KERNEL\r\nPrivacy policy in a post-Tornado Cash world with Electronic Frontier Foundation\r\nMEV and privacy with Flashbots and RookFi\r\n\r\nOur key differentiator is our vetted, high-trust, members-only environment, as well as community enforcement of good-faith communication principles. These conditions are necessary to inspire honest dialogue, fervent but respectful disagreement, strong rapport, and reliable coordination among a decentralized network of builders and investors. In turn, these qualities seed the emergence of consensus about baseline standards for agentic technologies that advance rather than deplete human dignity.\r\n\r\nWhat's Next?\r\n\r\nWhat started from a simple Telegram group grew into a high-trust, high-signal discourse club for builders and investors. We convene on Slack, Notion, and Zoom to engage in open dialogue, pressure-test new ideas, develop frameworks of thought, and cultivate consensus around acceptable tech standards, design choices, and social externalities.\r\n\r\nOver the past three months since our founding, we identified opportunities to further our mission:\r\n\r\n1. Agentic Future Summit\r\n\r\nNo amount of remote firesides, no matter how engaging the speaker or thrilling the subject matter, can ever replicate the effervescence of in-person interaction.\r\n\r\nThe success of our mission depends on trust, which is built on strong rapport.\r\nWe plan to organize the Agentic Future Summit, a side event at SXSW 2023 to gather the best thinkers and builders committed to securing a dignified human future with technology, including a series of workshops, focused talks, and intimate networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis grant will go towards space rental, catering, marketing, equipment, and people\u2019s time to organize and run it.\r\n\r\nDelivery Date: March 10-19 2023 (SXSW 2023)\r\n\r\n2. Privacy & Identity Landscape Map\r\n\r\nFounders of privacy-preserving protocols and projects that leverage decentralized identity are left on their own to navigate the labyrinthine ecosystem of infrastructure, data rails, DID specifications, encryption methods, and applications on their journey to define a critical path to product market fit. And new ones are emerge almost weekly. \r\n\r\nThis chaotic, creative, and hopeful space would benefit from an interactive, searchable, and dynamically updated map of the privacy and identity landscape to encourage greater awareness, coordination, collaboration among builders and funders.\r\n\r\nWe plan to:\r\n\r\nBuild a public website providing a taxonomy of projects allowing for hierarchical and categorical filtering and searching, including:\r\nIdentification: What the project is\r\nUse cases: What (end-user) problems this project helps solve\r\nDifferentiation: How this project differs from others\r\nTechnical analysis: Answer questions such as \u201cwhat user data stays private?\u201d and \u201cwhat does the user have consent over?\u201d\r\nProvide an interactive graphical representation of the landscape.\r\nPeriodically publish Gartner-style updates similar to the Thoughtworks Technology Radar.\r\n\r\nDelivery Date: Ongoing\r\n\r\n3. Content & Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nAlmost all of our discourse intentionally remains private, members-only content. This is by design. After all, discretion is what makes Yeet a unique, safe, and honest place to debate, debrief, and disagree.\r\n\r\nBut once half-formed ideas turn into inspired action, our shareable learnings should see the light of day! We want to allocate funding toward the production of a public podcast as well as articles and social media content.\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing Yeet\u2019s external voice and presence, grant funding would help offsets costs associated with async collaboration software, web development and hosting, and other internet services.\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nThere are 60 members in the discourse club, which is run by a small, agile team of core contributors who volunteer their time:\r\n\r\nAnastasia Uglova (Mirror | LinkedIn | Twitter)\r\nHoward Tam (LinkedIn | Twitter)\r\nChad Fowler (LinkedIn | Twitter)\r\n\r\nGrant funding will empower us to expand and accelerate capacity by compensating members for writing and delivering content, planning in-person events, handling outreach, programming, and scheduling for firesides, maintaining teams bios, contacts, and administrative work, and growing our membership.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nYeet 1-Pager\r\nThread: Privacy as a public good\r\nThread: Privacy and identity landscape\r\nEthCC x BlueYard Capital talk: The ethical obligations of tech founders and funders",

We are exploring both basic and translational research projects to fund. \r\n\r\nOur model is similar to VitaDAO, we plan to use all funds to fund research, and focus on advancing the projects we fund. Both Emil and Kai have experience in the cryonics research area and Vincent brings experience from VitaDAO. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to create a schelling point for people excited in crypto that want to learn more about and fund cryonics research. We plan to team up with VitaDAO where it makes sense to fund research together if the community is interested.\r\n\r\nSupporters\r\nEmil Kendziorra (Tomorrow Biostasis)\r\nKai Micah Mills (CryoPets)\r\nVincent Weisser (VitaDAO) \r\nand many more coming soon\r\n\r\nGreat read: \"Why Cryonics Makes Sense\" by Tim Urban\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about cryonics research\r\nHuman cryonics matters because it has the potential to allow people to be preserved at the cellular level and revived in the future. This could potentially allow humans to be resurrected after death. There are many research breakthroughs that still need to be made.\r\n\r\nCryopreservation, or the process of freezing cells, has been used for years by medical laboratories to preserve animal cells, human embryos, and even some organized tissues. However, it is not currently possible to revive large animals or organs from a frozen state. Large vitrified organs tend to develop fractures during cooling, and without cryoprotectants, cell shrinkage and high salt concentrations during freezing usually prevent frozen cells from functioning again after thawing. Ice crystals can also disrupt connections between cells that are necessary for organs to function.\r\nCryonicists argue that, as long as brain structure remains intact, it is possible to recover its information content. Cryonics proponents go further than the mainstream consensus in saying that the brain does not have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory. Cryonics controversially states that a human survives even within an inactive brain that has been badly damaged, provided that original encoding of memory and personality can, in theory, be adequately inferred and reconstituted from what structure remains.\r\n\r\nCryonics uses temperatures below \u2212130 \u00b0C, called cryopreservation, in an attempt to preserve enough brain information to permit the future revival of the cryopreserved person. Cryopreservation may be accomplished by freezing, freezing with cryoprotectant to reduce ice damage, or by vitrification to avoid ice damage. Even using the best methods, cryopreservation of whole bodies or brains is very damaging and irreversible with current technology.\r\nCryonics advocates hold that in the future the use of some kind of presently-nonexistent nanotechnology may be able to help bring the dead back to life and treat the diseases which killed them. Mind uploading has also been proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For this campaign to have legs, we need to reach thousands of shareholders.To do that, we are launching a marketing campaign (which requires advertising dollars). Aligned with our mission of tackling climate change through increased retail shareholder engagement, we're hoping to do a research sprint on on-chain credentials for shareholder voting rights.

We are building the rails for shareholders to exercise their power at the companies in their portfolio and advocate for the climate.To learn more about the role that shareholder proposals can have in tackling climate change, see here, here, and here.",

		"description": "Online advertising is in greater demand than ever before. However, due to the current situation of the advertising duopoly (Google Ads and Facebook Ads), the challenge of user privacy is gradually emerging.\r\n\r\nPrivacy laws are being tightened globally, but Google and Facebook are still in violation of GDPR. Users are forced to watch endless ads, risking privacy breaches, yet advertising fees are earned by the advertising platforms.\r\n\r\nAdMeta solves this problem by giving the ownership of user privacy back to the users.\r\n\r\nWith zero-knowledge proof, users are able to control and use their private data for advertising matchings, without exposing the data itself. By doing this, users are directly rewarded by advertisers.\r\n\r\nWe also introduce DID (decentralized identity) and SBT(Soulbound Token) to our platform, to enrich users' data for the best advertising services. Also, our audience segmentation is tailored for Web3.\r\n\r\nWe start this project on September 2021, and now we've already built an MVP including WebApp and our Blockchain Testnet. We are currently building our extension and SDK, to allow advertisers and users to access our network easily.\r\n\r\nWinning this grant definitely means a lot to us and we hope to be able to build our product with peace of mind, especially in this bear market environment. Thank you for your support!",

		"description": "About\r\n\tGravity DAO is a conflict management commons that is emerging from the cultural build of the Token Engineering Commons, to offer Alternative Dispute Resolution services to web3 communities. We are part of GravityDAO - together with my colleague we are building an Observational Psychological Research. We have a weekly meeting on TEC discord server in the Gravity voice channel every Monday at 11am EST.\r\n\tObservational research consists of systematic observation. \u201cSystematic\u201d involves a rational and reproducible procedure for collecting data. Data can be collected using a video recording device or a questionnaire. When the study is ready and the research is done, it will be published on an academic platform and Gravity Medium.\r\n\tSurveys are one of the most popular ways to find out what people think and one of the most common research methods in psychology. To build our research we needed to focus on specialized articles (from specialized literature). The main intention was to search for articles that talk about mental health in:\u00a0 work-family balance, remote work, sleep deprivation,boundaries, routine, shared identity, sadness, stress\u00a0 in personal life and DAOs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat do the articles say?\r\n\tIn the It\u2019s a New Era for Mental Health at Work, digital article, by Kelly Greenwood & Julia Anas (2021) we see that 68% of Millennials and 81% of Generation Z\u00a0 left their jobs for mental health reasons. When compared to the data collected from 2019, 50% of respondents in general left their roles both voluntarily and involuntarily (34% in 2019 ). \u201cNinety- one percent of respondents believed that a company\u2019s culture should support mental health, up from 86% in 2019.\u201d (Greenwood & Anas, 2021).\r\n\r\nExpectations of the study:\u00a0\r\n-informative and applicable for Web3 space\u00a0\r\n-the research and our studies will be helpful for many DAO contributors\r\n\u00a0-we measure progression over time\r\n\u00a0-it's replicable\r\n\u00a0-striving to implement psychology in DAOs\r\n\u00a0-raise awareness and bring psychologists to the space\r\n\u00a0-harmful mental health factors that are work relatable\u00a0\r\n\u00a0-isolate good practices for web3 and beyond\r\n\u00a0-gather preliminary research data that will be used for further developments\r\n\r\nThe Solution\u00a0\r\n\tWe see psychological tools being used in different areas, especially around Token Engineering Commons (TEC). But our goal is to have this field where we pay more attention to our surroundings either online or in real life and especially to ourselves. Our idea is to bring tools and resources that people will be able to get help from and feel safe if they need to talk to someone.\u00a0\r\n\tAfter collecting the results from the survey, the next step is to analyze it and create a free application where: psychological help is offered, guidance to a specialist psychologist, techniques and practical methods in different areas. We consider it ideal to offer our services to other DAOs. Also we want part of the application to have a social function -Where people can talk about how they feel. Only together we can build!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe link to the survey-\u00a0\r\nhttps:\/\/gravity.trabalhovivo.net\/\r\n\r\nOur team\u00a0\r\n\tWe are two women with a background in psychology leading this initiative, involved in the DAO space for 1.5 years. We are enthusiastic about promoting mental health in the DAOs space. Since December\/2021 we have been working on the creation of this research: showing our idea of the implementation of psychology in web3, gathering data and articles from different platforms, integrating with the community and finding that our research and desire to provide psychology to the DAO space was needed.\r\n\tTogether we collected more than 25 references and we got a collaboration with Universidade de Bras\u00edlia- Brazil (University of Brasilia) to develop the survey and publish the research in an academic way.\u00a0\r\nWe can't wait to take on new challenges and come up with useful solutions for the entire Web3 community.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nOur journey in Web3 has begun! We need funding for the development of the application and for new future research directions related to psychology and Web3.\u00a0\r\n\r\nP.S- Our website is in the finishing stage, it will be ready soon.",

Note that this scheme offers an improvement to semaphore or tornado cash nullifiers, because the first few people who sign up will not have small anonymity sets. The grant will also help to publish the paper that proves the security of the scheme via a DDH-VRF argument, and pay for conference expenses so it can be presented more widely.

		"description": "Problems we want to solve\r\nWith the continuous growth of ENS, we have witnessed the ENS secondary market grow and change rapidly. More and more clubs have been created and the sales performance of each club has been constantly changing. Also, the floor and sold price are under wide fluctuation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn order to constantly catch up with the market and better make their own ENS transaction decisions, name holders have growing demand to have a clear idea of the changeable ENS market sales performance.\u00a0\r\nHowever, since it is still a new market, the sales information is still scattered around all kinds of platforms including social media like Twitter and marketplace like the Opensea.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to have a clear idea of the market performance,\u00a0 users have to spend a lot of effort and time to go through different information channels to gather the scattered sales information, which is indeed hard and very inconvenient for them\r\n\r\nWhat we do\r\nOur website is a platform showing aggregated and in-depth sales information of ENS domains by extracting all the sales records from Opensea, Looksrare and other ENS marketplaces.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shows the overall sales data including sales volume, sales ranking, average sold price, floor & highest price of different clubs (e.g. 999 club, 3letters club) within different periods of time. What\u2019s more, we provide a convenient filter function for users to easily find the exact sales information they want. Here, users can filter sales information by different time period, different clubs, different name categories(e.g. Repeat 2, descend 3) .\u00a0\r\n\r\nMoreover, we visualized the sales volume and sales price into a dynamic chart. Users can easily find\u00a0 the price change and volume change by day of the specific types of names they select (e.g. Repeat 2 for 999 club in last 30d).\u00a0 By using this functions, users can easily follow up on the ENS market trend.\r\n\r\nBesides that, we also provide all detailed records of each ENS name\u2019s sales.\u00a0 Users can also rank the sales records by date\/ sold price\/first digit. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur value for ENS\r\nWe focus on accomplishing the following for ENS:\r\n\r\nUsability - improving the user experience\r\nInstead of spending a lot of effort to go through different platforms to gather the scattered sales information, users can conveniently have a comprehensive view of the ENS transaction market by using our website. Also they can easily find the exact information they want using our filter function.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCommunity - growing the ecosystem\r\nWe see that the market is rapidly growing and it is really hard for every active user in the community to constantly catch up with the market. WIth that idea, we want to be their support. By tracking all the transaction data in the ENS market and providing up-to-date insights, we hope we can let more community members easily understand the changeable market and let other newcomers see how promising the market is. Moreover, we believe our data can be a kind of tool for a lot of other brilliant community members to use to build up other powerful things. In the end, we can together help grow the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nEducation - Generating & Promoting content and educational resources about ENS\u00a0\r\nAlthough more and more people are joining the ENS market, most of them still don\u2019t have a thorough idea about the ENS market insights. Our website wants to educate users to become more expert in the market. Here, they can learn how to better use the data to discover insights of the market. For example, from the price chartthey can see when the price goes up and down and know when the market is prosperous and when to buy\/sell their own name property.\r\n\r\nFuture Development Plan \r\nWith the grant, we want to develop our website into a more powerful market analysis platform. Two more functions are under development:\r\n(1) More visualization\uff1a\r\nApart from the price chart, we are also considering to develop more visualization tools including sales volume chart, floor price chart and etc. We believe with more powerful visualization functions, users will find it more convenient to cultivate insights of the market. \r\n(2) Intelligent future forecast: \r\nBesides past sales data analysis, we also want to include future forecast function into our website. By analysing the past data, we can forecast future average sold price and volume of the ENS market. We believe this function will help more users master the ENS market.\r\n\r\n",

We are Sugoi protocol \ud83c\udf31\r\n\r\nWho?\r\n\r\nSugoi is web3\u2019s first green savings protocol where users can deposit their stablecoins, earn interest, and be able to redirect a percentage of that interest towards environmental NGOs. Users are incentivized by social impact, tax deductions and special rewards like NFTs.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nWe call Sugoi a green savings protocol because as you earn yield on your savings you also create impact for environmental causes hence our motto \u201cpark2impact\u201d.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nSugoi is a fully decentralized protocol that generates yield on users' deposits by depositing into decentralized lending protocols i.e. Aave and then automatically donating the yield while giving users access to their deposit with earned yield anytime. We also plant a tree for every time user makes a deposit to Sugoi \u2618\ufe0f.\r\n\r\nIn future, Sugoi will have an SDK to enable other web3 protocols to add green savings feature to their product.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nToday, there are a lot of stable coins in digital wallets today doing nothing. \r\nWhen we deposit money in a traditional bank that money is put to use by lending it out and earning yield for the bank. Sugoi was born while brainstorming how we can in fact \u2014 \u201cpark2impact\u201d putting your stable coins to use.\r\n\r\nOur core thesis is that there is a wide market of individuals who own stable coins but don\u2019t know how to put them to use. Sugoi gives users the ability to both earn yield and create impact in a way no other crypto native solution has attempted.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some research we found most individuals who own crypto have yet to use Decentralized Finance in any way, shape or form. We believe a few factors contributing to this would be the learning curve and onboarding hurdles. At Sugoi we are building an intuitive protocol with easy-to-use UI and docs that will enable smooth onboarding process to DeFi for the average native and non-native crypto user.\r\n\r\nTeam?\r\n\r\nWe are a team of three reimagining web3 for social impact with Shraddha leading, Mateo building, and Luciano expanding the Sugoi protocol. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019d be so grateful for your support in GR15 as we build web3 first must-have green savings protocol. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nSugoi Team",

		"description": "The mission of Web3 Women in Science (W3WS) is to address the critical underrepresentation of women and nonbinary individuals at the intersection of science and web3, sometimes referred to as \u201cDeSci\u201d for Decentralized Science. To our knowledge, W3WS is the only existing advocacy group specifically devoted to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the DeSci space.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Web3 Women in Science aims to onboard and support women in science as they navigate web3. Since January 2022, we have developed communication and networking hubs and facilitated numerous speaking opportunities without funding. We now seek funding to launch a compensated contributor program and evolve into an incorporated non-profit.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn January 2022, W3WS initially began as a series of Twitter Spaces devoted to amplifying the voices of women in DeSci. Inspired by this movement, a Telegram group was soon created to facilitate networking, and today this group has 161 members. As the needs of the community became more complex, plans for a full-fledged organization with branches for recruiting and onboarding, training and advising, and support and advocacy began to emerge. In June, a Discord server was launched with a structure in place to facilitate introductions and networking, aggregate DeSci community events, and provide access to liaisons from partner DeSci organizations to help newer contributors find their best fit in the DeSci ecosystem.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe currently have 97 verified Discord members (75 female, 20 male, 2 nonbinary), 49% of whom have completed onboarding by posting responses to our self-introduction questionnaire. Our server hosts liaisons from five partner DeSci organizations and counting: DeSci World, Vibe Bio, NeuraDAO, talentDAO, and AthenaDAO. We are also partnering with the women-led professional growth community xCollective to gather and analyze web3 compensation data in order to promote salary transparency and aid contributors with negotiations. Finally, in addition to our own Twitter Spaces, we have been called upon to organize panels at virtual conferences, including ResearchHub\u2019s SciCon 2022 and the upcoming Academic Web3 Conference, significantly expanding the limited opportunities for women in DeSci to access high-profile speaker slots.\r\n\r\nW3WS is now ready for its next evolution. To date, all initiatives have been 100% powered by a small team of volunteers, and unavoidable expenses (e.g. web hosting) have been covered by the founders. As we scale up and take on more numerous and ambitious projects, a different organizational structure is required. We are here requesting funds to: (1) launch a compensated contributor program and (2) to cover the consulting costs and fees required to formalize our organization as a legally recognized non-profit. The groundwork has already been laid for immediately actionable applications of the contributor program in content creation and research. Several writers, editors, and illustrators in the community have self-assembled with the skills and passion to produce a blog highlighting women\u2019s journeys in DeSci. Our researchers are also poised to gather elusive data on the demographics of the DeSci landscape and develop data-driven plans to improve diversity. By recruiting, onboarding, and supporting women, we shift DeSci demographics towards a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive future, which is also bound to be a more sustainable and successful future.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nW3WS Team\r\n\r\nAriella Coler-Reilly, MD PhD Candidate https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ariella-coler-reilly\/\r\nJocelynn Pearl, PhD https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jocelynnpearlphd\/\r\nSarah Hamburg, PhD https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sarah-hamburg-phd-9510a910a\/\r\nDani, MS https:\/\/twitter.com\/danielyse_\r\nZack West, BSc https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alphazwest\/\r\nIn\u00eas Santos Silva https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/inessantossilva\/\r\nJessica \/ TattooQueen, PhD https:\/\/twitter.com\/TattooQueenNFT\r\nRamona Kyabaggu, PhD Candidate, MSc, BHSc, CHIM https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ramonakyabaggu\/\r\n\r\nWebsite https:\/\/womeninscience.xyz\/\r\nTwitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/web3womeninsci\r\nTelegram https:\/\/t.me\/+Y6OzEBEnSaVkMTM8\r\nDiscord https:\/\/discord.gg\/P7kPtqRfJf",

		"description": "What is oscillo\r\noscillo is a P2P Matchmaking Protocol that puts price over everything. We aim to create a profitable trading environment that is friendly to crypto traders all around the world. In such a rapid and ever changing market, we want to become a place where all crypto traders can feel a sense of guarantee and safety. Now oscillo prioritizes value over time. We believe that it is important to put users\u2019 funds before the time it takes to complete an order. Our matchmaking system highlights this belief. We also believe that eventually, the two aspects will balance out, because as more users are drawn in because of the value of our transactions, they will begin to take less time. \r\n\r\nWhat makes oscillo unique\r\nIndex Price: Off-chain pricing system that uses the average price of various trusted markets.\r\nIndex-Limit Order: Only executed at index price when the index price satisfies or is more profitable than the trigger conditions.\r\nHybrid On\/Off chain: Off-chain pricing for slippage or MEV protection and on-chain settlement for reliable transaction.\r\nTrading Widget: oscillo\u2019s trading widget can support P2E games\u2019 in game auctions. The projects can charge a trading fee if they wish to do so. This means that projects can concentrate solely on game development instead.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the oscillo\u2019s benefit for traders\r\nGuaranteed Price: Trade any volume of tokens without losing money on price impact, slippage or MEV attacks.\r\nFree Trading: oscillo currently offers a zero trading fee promotion for all trading pairs to celebrate our launch.\r\nGasless(meta): The only thing you need to start trading is a gasless signature.\r\nGrowth Market: Market friendly to new tokens with liquidity providing issues. More profitable trades for users trading these tokens as there is significantly less slippage.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\nWe think these items are needed to trade reasonably in Defi. We will choose the top priority according to the traders\u2019 voices.\r\nDerivatives\r\nMultichain support\r\nBatch trade for stablecoins\r\nNFT trade\r\nAccounts for enterprises\r\nCombination trade\r\n",

Beginners can use Stripe, and pros can use Unlock Protocol (NFT utilities with their cryptocurrency of choice), to purchase their memberships.\r\n\r\nCategory: Web3, Community, Continuing Education, Developer Tools, K-12, Entertainment, and Media.\r\n\r\nThe Problem: Centralized Closed Platforms\r\nWhether it\u2019s Patreon, OnlyFans, Teachable, Shopify, etc\u2013 they own your content, your audience, your business, and so they basically own you.\r\n\r\nThe Solution: Decentralized Open Source Platforms\r\nIn the future, you will have a convenient open-source option. You will have the option of owning the software that you and your community use. You will own all of the rights to make the decision whether you want to run it on your own server, or pay somebody else to manage it for you. Either way, you own the full code repository and the database. You will own your business, and community\u2013 or it will be community owned.\r\n\r\nFunding:\r\nFunding will be used to get to Beta version, as well as fund Bonsai's grant program which will develop features such Masterclass (LMS), Shopify (e-commerce), Substack, and a metaverse university for web3. I will keep my focus on the core of the product (Patreon) until eligible grantees apply.\r\n\r\nRoadmap:\r\nBonsai is currently in pre-beta. Here are some things we'd like to accomplish before beta:\r\nRevenue splitting (gated access and streaming payments already accomplished with Unlock Protocol and Stripe)\r\nLaunch starter plan for $50\/m\r\nUpdate Bonsai courses (involves shooting and editing updated tutorials)\r\nFront-end Editing and Customizing (using ACF)\r\nEvents (as a custom post type)\r\nLaunch Bonsai Grants (Shopify, Masterclass, Substack, and metaverse university for web3)\r\nAfter Beta:\r\niOS app (shared content using WP-API)\r\nWidgets for daily check-ins from community (similar to BeReal or Insight Timer)\r\n\r\nTeam (Board Members of DAO):\r\nChris Do\r\nJulien Genestoux\r\nCurrently inviting: Tim Ferriss and Jonathan Courtney\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition and Key Differentiators:\r\nUnlike Patreon, Bonsai is Open Source and web3 ready out of the box.\r\nUnlike Creaton, Bonsai is web2\/web3 hybrid. It gives you the option to pay in cash or other trades of value. The type of content and perks you can offer is more flexible, including selling physical products. Also, Creaton isn't very active on Github, despite taking at $1.1M in funding.",

		"description": "Portals & Passages is a CC0, fully on-chain NFT collection of 1000 magical gates, called 'Portals'.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\nGenesis Era: The Ancient Schools of Enchantment competed to build magical Portals & Passages scattered across the Lootverse, and powered by rare Enchantment Gems;\r\nAge of Exploration: Adventurers traveled the world from Realm to Realm, to Dungeons, to Wonders, through Enchanted Portals & Passages managed by the Guild of Navigators.\r\nThe Mist: Portals were abandoned, their locations forgotten. But fragments about their existence survived in tales of the past.\r\nAge of Adventure: The Council of the 16 Orders and the Guild of Navigators tasked scholars from all Orders to locate and revive the Enchanted Portals & Passages. One by one Portals are being unearthed. Soon, Adventurers will voyage through, reaching faraway Dungeons, entering foreign Order lands, bowing down before Wonders, going back in Time\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nIt draws from deep loot lore:\r\n\r\n\r\nPortals & Passages is built with a CC0, composability, building block mindset, and aim to offer new possibilities for builders and writers to include movement of Characters across Places and Eras in their projects.\r\n\r\nThe Portals mapping (e.g. each Portal's location) will be generated by users, during the portals rediscovery (e.g. mint). Compatible ecosystems where users can define a location for their portals will be Realms and Crypts & Caverns to start with, and the contract will make it possible to add other ones over time. It will be possible for a given Portal to have a location in each compatible ecosystem, in the sense that a Portal magically coexists in different worlds, thus connecting them together.\r\n\r\nPortals could be seen as 'web3 hyperlinks'. Indeed they create connections both:\r\nbetween places in different on-chain worlds, through the coexistence of a given portal in different worlds;\r\nbetween places in a given on-chain ecosystem like Crypts & Caverns dungeons, by enabling all kind of builders creativity ideas on how to link 2 portals located in 2 different dungeons together.\r\n\r\nPortals come with on-chain SVG visual. We introduce an innovation on that front, by enabling multiple different SVG renderers, that users can choose from for their own Portals. We'll start with 2 original renderers (e.g. 'Loot OG' and 'Portals OG atmosphere') and it will be possible to add more over time (incl. renderers submitted by 3rd parties, like partner projects). Users can pass a byte array of customisation params that renderers can interpret (for example for letting users customise the background color). So for example referenced ecosystems where users can locate their Portals projects could also optionally develop and submit a Portals SVG renderer in cohesion with the atmosphere of their project (added to the list holders can choose from).",

This handbook is already becoming an actionable blueprint which enables, guides and assists aspiring builders to start, design, govern and incorporate their own regenerative villages. This is based on feedback from the re:build community (an organisation supporting localised events for village builders) stating a strong communal need for support.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need Tree House DAO?\r\nThere is no other web3 publishing organisation that focuses on regenerating the planet.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need a regenerative village builders handbook?\r\nEspecially since lockdown, many people have realised there might be a better alternative to being packed in concrete boxes, stacked on top of each other in increasingly hot cities that rely on fragile supply chains. Those of us looking for other ways of being want to live in regenerative villages that gives us a sense of true belonging, a connection to nature, to each other, and a sense of personal and collective purpose. But the process can seem daunting and complex, this means that many people get stuck in analysis paralysis and struggle to progress; therefore there is a need for a simple guide created by those who have already walked the path of regenerative living.\r\n\r\nIt is a complex, fast paced, ever changing landscape as more and more alternative ways of living and being are being experimented on. This means that a lot of progress and experience is happening constantly. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, there is a need for alignment of patterns, processes, successes and failures. With more and more fully functioning prototype villages, this means that there is plenty of real world experience to draw from.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow is the book writing being kicked-off?\r\nHosted as part of the re:build events series, and during a two week long Village Builders' Mastermind workshop at the Traditional Dream Factory\u00a0(TDF) - a prototype village of\u00a0Oasa Network - a group of 22 established regenerative village builders from around the world has convened to share knowledge & experience in order to co-create the open source Regenerative Village Builders' Handbook for aspiring regenerative village builders. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does TreeHouseDAO do to make a book?\r\nAssisted by the in-house TreeHouseDAO team of designers, writers, creatives who distil and visualise knowledge and the vast amounts of information generated we have a first draft of the book, the mastermind takes the participants on a fun, engaging journey of content creation to bring the book to life. Using a unique TreeHouseDAO created methodology we are able to co-create an entire book of 200 pages in just 10 days. Culminating in an open day where 15 more people from our extended community can come and critique the book and help finesse its content. We intend on repeating this process for all other organisations who wish to publish an open source book on any topic that helps regenerate the planet and its people.\r\n\r\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffChapters:\r\nPrologue - examples of villages\r\n1.

When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.\r\n\r\n## What is this agent\r\nAfter the sanction of Tornado Cash, many attackers move to other services to launder their money. Umbra Protocol is a stealth address protocol for Ethereum, meaning it allows a payer to send funds to a fresh address, which is controlled by the intended receiver, but only the payer and the receiver know that. Although technically speaking Umbra Protocol is not a mixer, its privacy protection feature makes it seem to be an alternative to Tornado Cash. Consequently, this agent will be built to monitor transfers related to Umbra Protocol, and hopefully, we can link the sender and receiver accurately based on its working principle.",

		"description": "Innovation in the way we learn is long overdue. Classrooms, grading systems, and similar structures were designed for the height of educational centralization and are heavily outdated. Blockchains are paving the way for decentralized peer-to-peer networks with programmable incentive mechanisms to emerge and create self-sustaining economic subsystems. Thus, it should be possible for us to experiment with cutting-edge learning techniques, incentives, and designs. Yet hardly any tooling is available to support that kind of experimentation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re here to change that.\r\n\r\nEducational tooling needs a structure of structures \u2014 a hyperstructure \u2014 crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries. Good education evolves, good minds evolve, tools improve, so the tenets of hyperstructure enable an open protocol where a massive diversity of approaches can exist on a unified data layer and hopefully birth an explosion in interoperable learning innovation, the community-driven creation of universal education, the meta public good.\r\n\r\nTo simultaneously meet the ever-growing need for education in the web3 community and beyond and to iterate on learning experiences in a manner that will allow the right primitives for hyperstructure to emerge, our inaugural experiment will leverage community expertise and pedagogical knowhow to rapidly create robust learning experiences on important emerging topics. These learning experiences will be offered to the community for open-source consumption, but if learners prefer a peer-to-peer learning experience, we will also offer cohort-based courses as rapidly as the content is curated. These guerilla style CBCs will surface the primitives that should be incorporated into a hyperstructure, scaled, and ultimately computed over and optimized.\r\n\r\nIn this mission, a Gitcoin grant serves two purposes:\r\n\r\n1. To fund the contributors who are developing curricula for the CBCs\r\n2. To fund developers working on the emergent primitive infrastructure we derive as a result of our learnings from the CBCs\r\n\r\nWhether your lens falls on the developing metacrisis and humanity's clear failure to coordinate at the scale necessary to secure a longterm safe future, the rising costs and sinking outcomes of traditional education, the political divisions that cause and are caused by that failure in the status quo, the growth of misinformation and censorship targeting those least likely to survive them, the current erosion of professional opportunity for our most talented educators, or all of the above\u2014the need for change, for conscious optimism, and for tinkering in our educational systems could not be more clear, or more urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"description": "\r\nMenthol Protocol strives to make regeneration more accessible, affordable and integrated seamlessly into our everyday actions. The goal is to empower climate leaders and decentralized communities to drive the transformation towards regenerative growth with our PERMISSIONLESS climate-action tool.\r\n\r\nMenthol Protocol is a web3 protocol with a foundation in place paving the way for our Menthol DAO which offers climate-positivity-as-a-service, including the entire end-to-end-process of calculating non-avoidable emissions, curating high-impact tokens, and purchasing these respectively in real-time. Tokenizers of environmental impact tokens love working with us, as we create a continuous business model between them and their customers. The first set of environmental impact tokens are CO2e and renewable energy credits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur mission is to live decentralization, but with regeneration first. Hereby, our first aim is nothing less than to turn the entire web3 space climate-positive, across all L1, L2s, dApps, communities, and individual wallet users. Forever. With just a few clicks. No-code integration allows for high interoperability across chains.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter fine-tuning this solution to decarbonizing web3, we want to offer the same service to any individual, community, or organization in the non-web3 world (web2). The first step towards climate change is reducing the individual carbon footprint through changes in behavior, new processes, and innovation. The second very important step to combat climate crises is calculating your non-avoidable emissions and over-compensating for them through for instance the mechanisms of the carbon offsetting market. Menthol Protocol automates this second step and brings climate positivity to anyone unleashing all ReFi projects. There is no excuse for turning climate positive, never has it been easier.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that we can build a leading climate-tech DAO amplifying existing ReFi ecosystems and building jointly towards a regenerative tomorrow with a self-motivating community capable of cooling the world with our tech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are 100% directing the requested funds from this grant to the offsetting efforts of web3, starting with projects mainly on Ethereum and Polygon. It will be used to develop incentives and awareness programs for projects and individuals to understand what CO2e impacts are and how to offset their carbon footprint in the web3 world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMenthol Protocol is building a public good to allow eventually any individual, organization, and community on planet Earth to offset their respective carbon footprint in a transparent, automated, secure, and verifiably impactful manner. Menthol Protocol is also then expanding into other impact tokens (starting with environmental).\r\n\r\nWe will be working on developing unique carbon footprint calculation metrics and methodologies for blockchain networks (web3) and the energy sector (web2). Our carbon footprint calculator will be open source and will be improved parallel to the scientific-based research, also published. There are many scientific metrics and methodologies for off-chain carbon footprint calculation, especially in the aviation, chemicals, and oil & gas industries. However, the web3 and non-web3 ecosystem is developing every other day as well as the methodologies to calculate non-avoidable emissions.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are a 20-person strong team, and growing, from all over the world covering every continent, and are ready to turn climate crises into climate action, serving, in particular, the ReFi web3 actors as an intelligent middleware. We have specialists on board and will further produce sound scientific literature and analysis not only on the calculation side but even more importantly on the supply side of high-quality impact tokens, starting with CO2e credits and renewable energy tokens.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Our Cool Team Here: https:\/\/www.mentholprotocol.com\/about\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d be so grateful for your support in GR15!\r\n\u00a0\r\nThank you!\r\n\u00a0\r\nFollow us on Twitter to Stay Cool! @MentholProtocol\r\nMenthol Protocol Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Collaborative experiences\r\n\r\nWe believe that art is for everyone.\u00a0Cryptomurals run local initiatives to support artists to create murals and tokenize their artworks in cities around ETH community events.\u00a0\r\n\r\nA geolocation-based scan system will allow participants to claim new murals and unlock exclusive content such as animations, AR experiences, or NFTs. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a03. Street-art hunters community\r\n\r\nOur platform will allow a collaborative process where individuals provide insights on the state of the artworks by city, securing the preservation of the heritage and keeping the archives updated.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe community will collaborate asynchronously in challenges around inclusion, culture promotion, and web3 adoption initiatives to fund street art as a public good while playing around.\r\n\r\nIt's a tool that can be used by anyone who wants to make their city a more beautiful place.\r\n\r\n\u00a04. The future of Cryptomurals\r\n\r\nCities and art festivals can integrate Cryptomurals as the leading platform to archive the cultural heritage of the murals in their location. We want to make it easy for anyone to use web3 tools to share their local murals with others worldwide.\u00a0\r\n\r\nInsights in the Cryptomurals platform will nurture the community's collective intelligence and the decision-making around local-run initiatives. Opportunities can include quadratic voting to promote new murals geolocations or support the renovation of existing spots.\r\n\r\nWe are a group of street artists and tech enthusiasts from Latin America who believe in inclusion thanks to art workshops and renovation of public spaces such as basketball yards, Sk8 parks, etc.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe believe in street art as a public good.\r\n\r\n\u00a05. Contributions\r\n\r\nWe're thrilled to share that we're making progress with our mission.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlong with the ETH Colombia community, we are building Cryptomurals graffiti tours to propose a street art hunting experience for Devcon6 visitors. Participants will discover Bogot\u00e1 and unlock exclusive content in our genesis. The experience will be organized by Cryptomurals and developed by Doingud.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe're excited to continue on this journey with the progressive support of our community, and we hope you will join us in our quest to extend the values of decentralization to fund public goods.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and jump into our Twitter and Instagram @cryptomurals to see the murals we started geolocating in Bogot\u00e1 for DEVCON 6!",
